I feel that it‚Äôs crucial to have a clear recognition of the value of your objective. That's the important thing. Recognizing that your objective is worthy, because it involves others' welfare or the general well-being of the community, gives you the determination to pursue it.
Compassion is one of the principal things that make our lives meaningful. It is the source of all lasting happiness and joy.
It is important to consider others at least as important as ourselves. This is the essence of spirituality.
Only tolerance and patience can protect us from the destructive effects of anger and hatred.

Self-centredness creates a distance from others, leading to dishonesty, fear and anger. This is how disturbing emotions work. While fear, hatred and anger, are bad for our health, concern for others leads to self-confidence and inner strength, while helping to reduce anger.

Compassion is a marvel of human nature, a precious inner resource, and the foundation of our well-being and the harmony of our societies.

Human beings are social animals. What brings us together is love and affection‚Äîanger drives us apart. Just as we employ physical hygiene to protect our health, we need emotional hygiene, the means to tackle our destructive emotions, if we are to achieve peace of mind.

Peace is not brought about through conflict, but through compassion‚Äîcreating peace of mind within ourselves. We all need compassion and women can take a lead role in encouraging others to let it flower within them. My own first teacher of kindness and compassion was my mother.
