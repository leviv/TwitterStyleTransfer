We are facing so many crises under Donald Trump:   COVID. Economic devastation. Unwarranted police violence. Emboldened white nationalists. A reckoning on race. Declining faith in a bright American future.  The common thread? A president who makes things worse — not better.

One of the ways the GOP articulates their racism today is their idea that some citizens are “real” people and others aren’t.  This is the argument they make against DC statehood: that this largely Black community doesn’t qualify as “real people.”  So, who is a “real” person? 🤔

Democrats sat on Dr. Ford’s letter for weeks. They kept it secret. They did nothing. And then they threw Dr. Ford’s wishes for confidentiality overboard and leaked it to the press. Does this sound like people who want to get to the truth? 
NYT show the videos of Biden, Pelosi &amp; Schumer saying the opposite in 2016.  EVERYONE reversed their positions bc circumstances are different.  History shows Senate confirms election-year noms when the same party as POTUS (17 of 19) &amp; blocks noms when different parties (2 of 10). 
Spent over an hour yesterday talking to 2 different TX doctors who BOTH told me they are seeing very positive  results using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID19.   Media flipped out bc Trump said good things about it.  The “study” they cite was retracted.

Compassion is something really worthwhile. It is not just a religious or spiritual subject, not a matter of ideology. It is not a luxury, it is a necessity.
Human beings are social animals. What brings us together is love and affection—anger drives us apart. Just as we employ physical hygiene to protect our health, we need emotional hygiene, the means to tackle our destructive emotions, if we are to achieve peace of mind.

The climate crisis threatens our way of life, and we must decarbonize our economy &amp; way of life to save the planet.  I wish it wasn’t such a bad situation too, but previous generations failed to act &amp; now young people need to deal w the science of our future &amp; create opportunity.

On top of a lie made up by a low-life “reporter”, who is known for disinformation, the Democrats have taken his false words and put them into a TV commercial. We now have 21 witnesses stating that the story is a BIG LIE. Even Biden admits this may not be true...

Today, we mark #BlackWomensEqualPayDay — the day in 2020 when Black women’s pay finally catches up with white men’s for 2019. We all must do our part every single day to shrink this gap. The House passed the #PaycheckFairness Act over a year ago. What’s your excuse, @senategop?
I sent @AndyLassner to work out with @MarkWahlberg. He couldn’t walk for 3 days after this. 
A careful reading of the Supreme Court rulings related to the President’s financial records is not good news for President Trump. The Court has reaffirmed the Congress’s authority to conduct oversight on behalf of the people, as it asks for further information from the Congress.

#ESQUIREuk @ellenvunwerth 
I really feel that some people neglect and overlook compassion because they associate it with religion. Of course, everyone is free to choose whether they pay religion any regard, but to neglect compassion is a mistake because it is the source of our own well-being.

This weekend, our San Francisco family was once again struck by the tragic loss of a child to gun violence. No parent — no family — should have to feel this pain. Last year, the House passed H.R. 8 to #EndGunViolence. The Senate must take swift action.

We all want to live a life free from turmoil, but we need to have a realistic method to achieve our goal. Warm-heartedness is essential—it yields a calm mind and self-confidence, enabling us to act openly, honestly and transparently, free from anxiety, fear and suspicion.
One of the lessons we need to learn is how to cultivate those positive emotions that counter destructive emotions like anger and fear. Compassion, for example, brings self-confidence and the ability to act transparently. It strengthens trust which is the ground for friendship.

Congress gave a $4 TRILLION check to Wall Street while sending mom+pops on a wild goose chase for PPP.  That is major, oligarchic, economy-shaping power Congress just gave the wealthy.  The LEAST we should do is halt big mergers during COVID to slow the consolidation of sectors.

.@AliciaKeys told me about hosting the Grammys on a tough day. 
For many people, the only tangible value is money. And of course money has its place, but the value of cultivating a compassionate attitude is much more effective. When we only pay attention to material values, there’s little room for concern for others, or for mutual regard.
Live: HHDL's teaching on Stages of the Path to Enlightenment &amp; Overview of Tantra from Dharamsala, India August 25-27 
In President @realDonaldTrump, the people of Pennsylvania see someone who has kept all of the promises he’s made. We’ve rebuilt our military, revived the economy through less taxes and less regulation, had more American energy, &amp; stood by the right to life and religious liberty. 
Anger can be reduced if we work to cultivate love and affection. However, we first have to come to terms with whatever benefits or disadvantages anger may bring. Primarily, anger destroys our peace of mind; loving-kindness earns us friends and eliminates the risk of being alone.

If you want to know why COVID relief is tied up in Congress, one key reason is that Republicans are demanding legal immunity for corporations so they can expose their workers to COVID without repercussions.  Dems don’t want you to die for a check. That’s what we’re fighting over.

As cases rise and schools are forced to shut down, it’s deeply important that ALL students get the resources and technology they need to learn at home. No one should be shut out of education. 
For those upset about critique of establishment politics:  There are D reps in SAFE blue seats who side w/ the NRA, are anti-LGBT+, and yet are protected because they advance the interests of big donors, Wall St, fossil fuels, etc.  It’s not “wrong” to take that on and do better. 
Discouraging to see that Dems want to ignore the pleading of people who are still hurting and reject #COVID19 relief. Can’t think of any good reason to deny them that help. I hope that cooler heads can prevail, and we’ll get to work and come up with a solution

It was an honor to join @POTUS at the White House today for the signing of the CARES Act.   The American people needed this rescue package. They needed it quickly. And the Senate delivered, 96-0. It's a proud moment for our country. 
Democrats’ impeachment obsession has delayed crucial governing responsibilities to the 11th hour: Funding for the federal government, money for our troops, must-pass legislation for national defense. Basic, bipartisan work for our country that Democrats have been blocking.
Because of the Republican Senate’s betrayal of the Constitution, the President remains an ongoing threat to American democracy, with his insistence that he is above the law and that he can corrupt the elections if he wants to.

Our country is starting to carefully re-open. Any further legislation will need to focus on practical solutions that help kids return to school next fall, help laid-off Americans get re-hired, and stop frivolous lawsuits from stalling our recovery. 
The fight to tackle climate change took a big step on Friday with hundreds of countries signing the #ParisAgreement. 
Our medical professionals are heroes putting their lives on the line to keep our country going. Here's a look at how an ER doctor who already fought on the front lines of one crisis makes it through a day in this one. A good reminder for us to help them out by staying home.

The floods in the Midwest and in southern Africa are heartbreaking. Suffering and loss on two sides of the world calls for solidarity and strength from all of us. Ask what you can do to help our fellow Americans and families in need. Here are some ideas: 
🚨 Whenever people try to tell you you don’t love America if you criticize Donald Trump, show them this.   
‘This body, this chamber, exists precisely so that we can look past daily dramas and understand how our actions will reverberate for generations. The House’s hour is over. The Senate’s time is at hand. It is time for this proud body to honor our founding purpose.’ 
We are a more just, more equal nation because of Justice Ginsburg. Now it’s up to all of us to carry on her fight. 
Weapons of war have no place in our communities.  We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
I send my love to Amanda Kloots and Elvis on their unthinkable loss. My heart breaks for Nick Cordero’s family and friends. @Amandakloots, your strength through Nick’s struggle with COVID-19 has been inspiring. You are in my heart today.

Developing love and compassion and reducing anger and spite is a universal activity which requires no faith in any religion whatsoever.
When we've been at such crossroads before, Americans have made the right choice. Not because we sat back and waited for history to happen -- but because we marched, and mobilized, and voted. We made history happen.

Very odd. Both Hirono &amp; Booker asserted sexual orientation is “immutable.”  Webster’s defines as “not capable of or susceptible to change.”  I wasn’t aware the Left insisted sexuality can never change over the course of one’s life.  While insisting gender can change continuously.
Vanessa Guillen’s family deserves justice.  What happened to her, and to so many victims of sexual harassment and assault in the military, is utterly unacceptable.  We need an independent investigation. Thank you @RepSylviaGarcia for leading the charge.

Compassion enhances our self-confidence because a calm mind allows our marvellous human intelligence to bloom. When we’re angry, our thinking is distorted and we don’t see the different aspects of reality. A calm mind enables us to take a broader, more realistic view.
Great to be at @BVFoodBank today to discuss the more than $124 million the Bryan-College Station region has received in coronavirus relief funding so far from Congress.

In 2019, under Republican policies:  - Fastest annual growth in household income on record - Working-class &amp; middle-class families saw more of the gains - Poverty lowest since 1950s   That's the leadership our nation will need as we rebuild after COVID. 
Joe Biden’s left wing policy agenda looks more and more like Bernie won. Our Country can’t afford to have a leader who puts radical climate change plans like the Green New Deal ahead of American jobs. America needs four more years of President @realDonaldTrump. #MAGA
War is a class conflict, too. The rich and powerful who open war escape the consequences of their decisions. It’s not their children sent into the jaws of violence.  It is often the vulnerable, the poor, &amp; working people -who had little to no say in conflict - who pay the price.

Can we please get people stimulus checks and mortgage relief and rent forgiveness and small business support and free testing and hazard pay and healthcare for the uninsured (&amp; underinsured) in the middle of a pandemic or is that too socialist too?

She doesn't answer their questions because she feels no accountability to them or the process. Just towards Trump and his cult.   And she'll be no different on the court. 
I will be speaking with reporters regarding the ongoing efforts to put #FamiliesFirst in our COVID-19 crisis response at 10:45 am ET at the U.S. Capitol.  Tune in here:

In the past 2 months, we’ve  voted TWICE on $500 billion in COVID relief. Both times, Senate Dems filibustered the bill.  You should call on your own party to stop blocking relief.  EVERY SINGLE Dem voted to filibuster.  I suspect you never reported on that fact to your viewers.

To me, all these features that differentiate us, like wealth, position, status, and so on, are secondary. I truly believe we can learn to relate to one another on the basis of our shared humanity. And if individuals can learn to do that, there’ll immediately be a basis for trust.
It’s surreal that an unhinged President of the United States would repeatedly say my name at his cult rallies.  Or that Americans would even elect someone like him.  24 years ago, if someone told my father when we arrived as refugees, he would’ve advised them to seek help.  Vote!

Taxing more, spending more, and seizing more power away from the people. That is the Democrats’ hammer of choice -- and in every part of American life they see a nail. They’re sprinting as far left as possible, trying to outdo one another.

Intelligence should never be guided by partisanship or politics. Rep. John Ratcliffe’s embrace of conspiracy theories and distrust of law enforcement &amp; intelligence patriots disqualify him from leading America’s intel community.

Even though the Democrats’ own top member on the Intelligence Committee praises this nominee and wants a swift confirmation, Senate Democrats still forced us to use hours of floor time and multiple votes, as if he were controversial. This is what I've called mindless obstruction.

Nancy Pelosi said she got “set up” by the owner (a very good one) of a beauty parlor. If so, how will she do in negotiations against President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia, or Kim Jong Un of North Korea. Not so well, I suspect, but far better than Joe Hiden’ would do!

96% of airline profits over the last decade went to buying up their own stocks to juice the price - not raising wages or other investments.  If there is so much as a DIME of corporate bailout money in the next relief package, it should include a reinstated ban on stock buybacks.

The House has been at home for two months. They gave themselves no assignments except developing this proposal. Yet it still reads like the Speaker of the House pasted together random ideas from her most liberal members and slapped the word “coronavirus” on top of it.

It’s not a coincidence that the GOP advanced tropes about non-citizenship to President Obama, Reps. Tlaib, Omar &amp; Pressley, &amp; now Sen. Kamala Harris; especially in moments of power.  Implying poc “don’t belong” in our country is one way of protecting a white supremacist vision.
I was glad to speak with @JustinTrudeau yesterday. We discussed several important matters that the United States and Canada are tackling together as neighbors and friends, including the USMCA.
Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi’s first draft from late last night was off-base. It does not focus immediate relief on affected Americans. It proposes new bureaucracy that would only delay assistance. It wanders into policy areas that are not related to the pressing issues at hand.

Racial and religious hate mongering deserves swift condemnation. I’m glad the House of Representatives is taking up a resolution to reject antisemitism. But I’m sorry it had to be prompted by the repeated invocation of hurtful stereotypes by a Democratic member of the House.
At this moment, we're facing both the worst public health crisis of our lifetime and the existential threat of climate change.  We need a president who believes in science.
We need worker-centered policies that reign in Wall Street and value work - including a TON of unvalued and undervalued work, like caregiving.  The cost of system that concentrates a billion dollars in the hands of few powerful people is massive, devastating income inequality.

Ironic that Sen Klobuchar is worried about future SCOTUS decision on ACA when Ds have moved on to support Medicare for All which would supplant the ACA, eliminate insurance you get on the job, and bankrupt current Medicare for seniors.

200,000 Americans have died from this virus.  It’s a staggering number that’s hard to wrap your head around. But behind every COVID-19 death is a family and community that will never again be the same.  There’s a devastating human toll to this pandemic — and we can’t forget that.

TERRIBLE advice. Why are families disintegrating, kids being raised alone &amp; angry? Today’s secular wisdom—“you’re mad your wife helped her family? Get a divorce!”—is a big reason why.   Here, the wife acted poorly; they should have discussed it. But family matters. Kids matter.

Are You Watching Your State Lawmaker Elections? Here's Why You Should 
Truth 
President @realDonaldTrump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett because she is a brilliant jurist who will uphold the Constitution, interpret the law as written and will not legislate from the bench. 
Retribution isn’t law and order. It’s tyranny.   He is advocating against citizens’ 5th amendment right to due process.   This is unconscionable. 
The sky never falls. But the hyperbole and hysteria on #SCOTUS nominees do not end. My weekend op-ed in the Cincinnati @Enquirer: 
Cynics, take note: When we #ActOnClimate, we build a stronger future. 
Donald Trump has been trying to throw out Obamacare for years.  And now he sees an opportunity to finally get it done, all while ignoring the will of the people.  We can’t let him.

Chris Wallace, who beclowned himself with a shamefully biased debate performance—universally panned—continues to demonstrate his rank partisanship.  Urging that we follow the law &amp; that election recounts be actually completed is not somehow undermining democracy. 
Senate Republicans are dedicated to providing additional, nonpartisan funding that fits our shared priorities and will help countless Texans, but Democrats continue to prevent the Senate from even debating another #COVID19 relief bill. This is shameful.

More than 9 million cases of COVID-19 have been now confirmed in the United States — and more than 228,000 Americans have lost their lives.  It is as severe an indictment of a president’s record as one can possibly imagine, and it is utterly disqualifying.

The coronavirus doesn't care about our election. But it's clear that's all Democrats care about. Look at the facts and ask each Democrat what in the proposal that we're voting on tomorrow they actually disagree with.   More historic funding for schools? Jobs? Healthcare? 
Night in 
Not sure what you are rambling about, but we are all enthusiastic to rid our country of your weak leadership—or should I say lack of leadership.  We all want to expand healthcare and address the climate crisis. You want to take away people's healthcare and are a climate denier. 
Last night was a debate between two visions for America. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want higher taxes, socialized medicine, to abolish fossil fuels, to use taxpayer funds for abortion, to defund the police, and to pack the Supreme Court. 
Climate change is real, but so is the progress we're making to #ActOnClimate. Let's keep it up.

Ilhan’s multimillion challenge was bankrolled by DC lobbyists &amp; dark money groups.  He blatantly admitted to using shell corporations to get around the DCCC blacklist, which all but means his vendors work w/ the Democratic Party.  Yet DCCC hasn’t enforced policy. I wonder why 🤔

House Democrats' last attempt at a coronavirus response was a go-nowhere liberal wish list that even the media laughed off. With 40+ COVID hearings by the end of this week, the Senate is continuing the serious, facts-first approach that built the historic CARES Act.
Eviction, foreclosure, &amp; shut-off suspensions are good but they are nowhere near enough.  People don’t want to be in the position where the moment the orders are lifted there will be a marshal at their door. They still feel like rent is due unless a payment moratorium is called.

Neal, you’re a good friend, but you know first-hand that the Deputy SG (career or not) speaks on behalf of the Administration. And (as you admit) the Obama Admin’s position was, as Stewart argued, “WE COULD PROHIBIT the publication of the book using the corporate treasury funds.”

Every time an American is forced to ration medication or not fill a prescription, it's a failure of Senate Republicans.  The House has voted to allow HHS to negotiate for #LowerDrugCosts.  How long do families have to wait for @SenateMajLdr to do the same? 
The NDAA authorizes the resources that our men and women in uniform depend on, from Ft. Knox and Ft. Campbell in my home state of Kentucky to installations around the country -- and around the world.

When President Trump was told one thousand Americans were dying every day from COVID-19, he shrugged it off and said, "it is what it is."  It is what it is?  This president doesn't even pretend to care about the Americans he swore to serve. It's disgraceful.

Opioid Crisis: Critics Say Trump Fumbled Response To Another Deadly Epidemic 
.@oceans8movie June 8 💅🏾💅🏾💅🏾💅🏾💅🏾💅🏾💅🏾💅🏾 
President Obama and I left President Trump a playbook on how to deal with pandemics. He flat-out ignored it. And we're suffering every day because of it.
We do more testing than any country in the World, by far, over 55 million tests. Fake News @CNN says we should do more testing. But even if we did 100 times more, they would then say it is still not enough. They are totally discredited, just want Sleepy Joe to win in November! 
To get our Country working again is to put the Coronavirus in the past, and we are on our way to doing just that. We urge every American to keep following the guidelines so that we can safely and responsibly reopen our Nation.

First you called us Castro communists, then...Nazis. All while claiming the “high” road.  I’m proud to fight for Texas.  You’ve chosen to make millions being funded by forces pushing for open borders, socialism, destruction of the Bill of Rights &amp; ANTIFA mobs burning our cities. 
Sure hope this isn’t true. It is the non-linearities, such as Siberian permafrost melting or ocean currents changing, that are most difficult to predict. 
Always great talking to @KingJames and @MavCarter about everything from this unique NBA season to the importance of voting in every election. Tune in tonight and make your plan to vote:
