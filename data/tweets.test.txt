Nobody wants Sleepy Joe as a leader, including the Radical Left (which he lost last night!). He disrespected Bernie, effectively calling him a loser!
Developing concern for others, thinking of them as part of ‚Äòus‚Äô, brings self-confidence, reduces our sense of suspicion and mistrust, and enables us to develop a calm mind. This is important, because a calm mind can help us better cope with physical discomfort and other problems.

People inflict pain on others in their selfish pursuit of happiness and satisfaction. Yet true happiness comes from a sense of brotherhood and sisterhood. We need to cultivate a sense of universal responsibility for one another and the planet we share.
Our life depends on others so much that at the root of our existence is a fundamental need for love. That is why it is good to cultivate an authentic sense of responsibility and concern for the welfare of others.

Unlike physical progress, which is subject to natural restrictions, the qualities of the mind can be developed limitlessly.
Cultivating a genuine sense of concern for others‚Äô well-being is the basis for the trust that makes happiness and friendship possible.
I am one of the 7 billion human beings alive today. We each have a responsibility to think about humanity and the good of the world because it affects our own future. We weren‚Äôt born on this planet at this time to create problems but to bring about some benefit.
Hope everyone has a happy New Year!
Ours is a globalized world. Climate change affects us all; no one can hide from it. The global economy means we need to think of other people as members of one global family. This is why we need humane values based on common sense and common experience in our education systems.

Love, compassion and concern for others are real sources of happiness.
Self-centredness creates a distance from others, leading to dishonesty, fear and anger. This is how disturbing emotions work. While fear, hatred and anger, are bad for our health, concern for others leads to self-confidence and inner strength, while helping to reduce anger.

Our testing is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country (we have done a great job on this!) that it shows more cases. Without testing, or weak testing, we would be showing almost no cases. Testing is a double edged sword - Makes us look bad, but good to have!!!

A source of trouble is that our minds are unruly. We need to effect an inner transformation, to understand that love and affection are a real source of joy. It‚Äôs important to be warm-hearted rather than selfish. We‚Äôll be less sick, live longer and have more friends here and now.
More important than being loved is to love.

The extreme difficulty of scaling production of new technology is not well understood. It‚Äôs 1000% to 10,000% harder than making a few prototypes. The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself.
Prayer by itself is not sufficient to bring about peace of mind. What is much more effective is coming to understand the workings of the mind and learning how to tackle the mental afflictions that disturb it.
Everyone wants to lead a happy life, a meaningful life. In order to fulfil this goal our practice should be realistic.

We may say prayers when we are trying to solve the problems we face, but it is up to us to put an end to violence and bring about peace. Creating peace is our responsibility. To pray for peace while still engaging in the causes that give rise to violence is contradictory.
We need to try and solve problems in a spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood, in a spirit of reconciliation and compromise.

A compassionate attitude opens our inner door, and as a result it is much easier to communicate with others.
If we were really to see one another as brothers and sisters, there would be no basis for division, cheating and exploitation among us. Therefore it‚Äôs important to promote the idea of the oneness of humanity, that in being human we are all the same.

I often ask myself what is the purpose of our lives and I conclude that life's purpose is to be happy. We have no guarantee what will happen in the future, but we live in hope. That's what keeps us going.
Peace of mind is the basis of a healthy body and a healthy mind; so peace of mind, a calm mind, is very, very important.
Love and compassion arising with a clear recognition of the importance and rights of others will reach even those who would do you harm.

As a human being I am committed to trying to share with others that we are social creatures, because of which, whether we are religious believers or not, we need a sense of concern for others‚Äô well-being.
Anger and aggression sometimes seem to be protective because they bring energy to bear on a particular situation, but what needs to be acknowledged is that that energy is blind. It takes a calm mind to be able to consider things from different angles and points of view.
Love born in the brain is more spirited, doubtless, than true love, but it has only flashes of enthusiasm; it knows itself too well, it criticizes itself incessantly; so far from banishing thought, it is itself reared only upon a structure of thought. üñ§The Red and The Black‚ô•Ô∏è

It's unrealistic to think that the future of humanity can be achieved through prayer or good wishes alone; what we need is to take action.
Compassion is a mental quality that can bring us true lasting inner peace and inner strength.

Time‚Äôs always moving on; nothing can stop it. We can‚Äôt change the past, but we can still learn from it. And we can shape the future, creating a more peaceful era, by adopting a realistic approach, recognising that the more compassionate you are, the more you‚Äôll find inner peace.

There needs to be a systematic approach to introducing inner values, a warm-hearted concern for all human beings, into education.
Sleepy Joe Hiden‚Äô was acknowledged by his own people to have done a terrible job on a much easier situation, H1N1 Swine Flu. The OBiden Administration failed badly on this, &amp; now he sits back in his basement and criticizes every move we make on the China Virus. DOING GREAT JOB!

We have to find ways to encourage non-violence, compassion and respect for others‚Äô rights to achieve a better world in the future.
Science and technology has brought much development, and yet we still face many man-made problems. We are social animals. We depend on the community in which we live. Therefore, we need a sense of global responsibility, because the well-being of humanity is our own well-being.

Whatever our religious faith, showing others loving kindness is the best way to bring about inner peace.
Anger and aggression sometimes seem to be protective because they bring energy to bear on a particular situation, but that energy is blind. It takes a calm mind to be able to consider things from different angles and points of view.

The Fake News and phony Fake Suppression Polls have never been worse. The Lamestream Media has gone CRAZY!
As human beings we are all the same. We have this marvellous intelligence, which sometimes creates problems for us, but when influenced by warm-heartedness it can be really creative and helpful. This is the context in which having moral principles is of such great value.
how advanced our society has become.. merely 100 years ago you would receive little to no praise for posting the words "Bart Flintstone"
The number of ChinaVirus cases goes up, because of GREAT TESTING, while the number of deaths (mortality rate), goes way down. The Fake News doesn‚Äôt like telling you that!
We need to promote the oneness of all human beings, on the basis of which there are no grounds for killing or exploiting others.

Mail-In Voting is already proving to be a catastrophic disaster. Even testing areas are way off. The Dems talk of foreign influence in voting, but they know that Mail-In Voting is an easy way for foreign countries to enter the race. Even beyond that, there‚Äôs no accurate count!
As social animals we need friends, but we make friends on the basis of trust, which comes about as a result of affection and concern for others. You can‚Äôt buy trust or acquire it by use of force. Its source is warm-heartedness.
By the way, I am actually a socialist. Just not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm. True socialism seeks greatest good for all.

The quality of our actions, whether they are positive or negative, depends on our motivation. This is why we have to transform our minds.
Spiritual practice involves, on the one hand, acting out of concern for others' well-being. On the other, it entails transforming ourselves so that we become more readily disposed to do so.
The true hero is one who conquers his own anger and hatred.
