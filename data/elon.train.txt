It‚Äôs super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage 
Max recovered booster velocity was Mach 7.9 (BulgarianSat). Energy is velocity squared, so this is a bigger difference than it appears
Basic premise is that it's better to try to address some of the world's problems than to create an aristocracy of wealth
I am actually going to do this
There are many chapters of bankruptcy and, as critics so rightly pointed out, Tesla has them *all*, including Chapter 14 and a half (the worst one).
High velocity reentry (2700 lbs/sqft) appeared to succeed, but, as expected, not enough propellant to land for this and the next mission.
All satellites deployed
Worth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits &amp; unpaid public health costs 
Worth noting that Boeing/Lockheed ("Other US" on chart) get a billion dollar annual subsidy even if they launch nothing. SpaceX does not. 
Pack swap now operating in limited beta mode for SF to LA route. Can swap battery faster than visiting a gas station. Tesla blog out soon.

Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust.

Our true competition is not the small trickle of non-Tesla electric cars being produced, but rather the enormous flood of gasoline cars pouring out of the world‚Äôs factories every day
But actually

Btw, price of Model X is actually only $5k more than S. Lower cost versions coming later.

Cybertruck is our last product unveil for a while, but there will be some (mostly) unexpected technology announcements next year
Model S Performance powertrain produced so much torque today that we broke the dyno. 4.4 sec 0-60 mph will not be a problem.
Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.
To be clear, SpaceX is supporting a student design competition for STEM, not trying to build Hyperloop itself. Other cos are doing latter.
Just did crazy Japanese game show called ÈÄÜËª¢„ÅÆÊ≥ïÂâá. I have no idea what happened, but it was awesome 
Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k.
Much will likely go wrong on 1st mission. Also, 6 more launches of 60 sats needed for minor coverage, 12 for moderate.

Regarding Tesla patents 
Tomorrow is Part 1 of the Model 3 unveil. Part 2, which takes things to another level, will be closer to production.
Dragon 2 is designed to land on any surface (liquid or solid) in the solar system. Am glad to see people thinking about applications!

Should mention that the battery cells used for this are 200 Wh/kg vs 250 for Model S. No short term supply constraint.

Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by 2030 as the US does from all sources today 
Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.
Would also like to thank @USAirForce for allowing us to use their long range comm system for Dragon in free drift.
There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc 
Mars requires developing complex technology over a decade+, but market cares about next 3 months. Result would be conflicting priorities.

A Tesla works as a boat for short periods of time, as an electric car has no air intake or exhaust to block &amp; battery/motor/electronics are water-sealed. Submarines are just underwater EVs.   
Upper stage restart nominal, apogee raised to 7000 km. Will spend 5 hours getting zapped in Van Allen belts &amp; then attempt final burn for Mars.

But if humanity wishes to become a multi-planet species, then we must figure out how to move millions of people to Mars.

Forgot to say one thing at Tesla annual shareholders meeting: just as my money was the first in, it will be the last out.
Falcon Heavy hold-down firing this morning was good. Generated quite a thunderhead of steam. Launching in a week or so. 
Tesla solar panels are $1.49/Watt  
Improving service and honing manufacturing efficiency are the biggest short term challenges. Not sales constrained.
Boring machine segments have been lowered into the starter tunnel. Going through final assembly.‚Ä¶ 
If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h.
Going at full speed! MT ‚Äú@iansomerhalder: Elon- you are my hero my friend.Please!Ramp up production on cars that use NO gas."

What‚Äôs actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day.

There is no slowdown of the Gigafactory construction underway, as anyone near Reno with eyes can verify. It's not subtle.
Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that @boringcompany built a 6000 ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally 10X better, should be operational next year. For reference:

How Model 3 performs on a long road trip  
Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship &amp; booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) &amp; sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).
Over a million combustion engine (it‚Äôs right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question.
Glad you‚Äôre enjoying Model 3 &amp; thanks for buying a Tesla! Major enhancements to Autopilot &amp; fun games coming in a month with V9.0.
