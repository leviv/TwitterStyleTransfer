It‚Äôs super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage 
Max recovered booster velocity was Mach 7.9 (BulgarianSat). Energy is velocity squared, so this is a bigger difference than it appears
Basic premise is that it's better to try to address some of the world's problems than to create an aristocracy of wealth
I am actually going to do this
There are many chapters of bankruptcy and, as critics so rightly pointed out, Tesla has them *all*, including Chapter 14 and a half (the worst one).
High velocity reentry (2700 lbs/sqft) appeared to succeed, but, as expected, not enough propellant to land for this and the next mission.
All satellites deployed
Worth noting that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits &amp; unpaid public health costs 
Worth noting that Boeing/Lockheed ("Other US" on chart) get a billion dollar annual subsidy even if they launch nothing. SpaceX does not. 
Pack swap now operating in limited beta mode for SF to LA route. Can swap battery faster than visiting a gas station. Tesla blog out soon.

Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust.

Cybertruck is our last product unveil for a while, but there will be some (mostly) unexpected technology announcements next year
Model S Performance powertrain produced so much torque today that we broke the dyno. 4.4 sec 0-60 mph will not be a problem.
Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.
To be clear, SpaceX is supporting a student design competition for STEM, not trying to build Hyperloop itself. Other cos are doing latter.
Just did crazy Japanese game show called ÈÄÜËª¢„ÅÆÊ≥ïÂâá. I have no idea what happened, but it was awesome 
Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k.
Much will likely go wrong on 1st mission. Also, 6 more launches of 60 sats needed for minor coverage, 12 for moderate.

Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by 2030 as the US does from all sources today 
Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.
Would also like to thank @USAirForce for allowing us to use their long range comm system for Dragon in free drift.
There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc 
Mars requires developing complex technology over a decade+, but market cares about next 3 months. Result would be conflicting priorities.

A Tesla works as a boat for short periods of time, as an electric car has no air intake or exhaust to block &amp; battery/motor/electronics are water-sealed. Submarines are just underwater EVs.   
Upper stage restart nominal, apogee raised to 7000 km. Will spend 5 hours getting zapped in Van Allen belts &amp; then attempt final burn for Mars.

Forgot to say one thing at Tesla annual shareholders meeting: just as my money was the first in, it will be the last out.
Falcon Heavy hold-down firing this morning was good. Generated quite a thunderhead of steam. Launching in a week or so. 
Tesla solar panels are $1.49/Watt  
Improving service and honing manufacturing efficiency are the biggest short term challenges. Not sales constrained.
Boring machine segments have been lowered into the starter tunnel. Going through final assembly.‚Ä¶ 
If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h.
Going at full speed! MT ‚Äú@iansomerhalder: Elon- you are my hero my friend.Please!Ramp up production on cars that use NO gas."

What‚Äôs actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day.

There is no slowdown of the Gigafactory construction underway, as anyone near Reno with eyes can verify. It's not subtle.
Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that @boringcompany built a 6000 ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally 10X better, should be operational next year. For reference:

How Model 3 performs on a long road trip  
Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship &amp; booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) &amp; sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).
Over a million combustion engine (it‚Äôs right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question.
Glad you‚Äôre enjoying Model 3 &amp; thanks for buying a Tesla! Major enhancements to Autopilot &amp; fun games coming in a month with V9.0.

Compared to past, today's world is fantastic &amp; likely will be for many decades. Just need to cover future downside risk.
And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it‚Äôs electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements.
Already testing traffic lights, stop signs &amp; roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all.
Goal is for repaired car to be better than before accident. Should always be true if damaged/used parts are correctly replaced with newer parts.

HW2 Autopilot software uploading to 1000 cars this eve. Will then hold to verify no field issues and upload to rest of fleet next week.
Letter from @SenJohnMcCain to DoD Inspector General questioning uncompeted space launch contract 
It is crazy that the proposed California high speed rail only goes 200 mph w avg speed of 130 mph when Japan is 300 mph+
Sounds like Consumer Reports had a good experience with the Tesla Model S 
First kit set will be ancient Egypt ‚Äî pyramids, Sphinx, temple of Horus, etc
Next step for @BoringCompany Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).
The first owner to drive coast to coast in a Model S is about to complete the journey @XCTeslatrip!

Once again, I must recommend  
Tesla Model S estimated EPA range is now above 390 miles or ~630 km 
High altitude wind shear data shows a probable 2% load exceedance. Small, but better to be paranoid. Postponing launch to tomorrow, assuming winds are better then.
These were based on direct requests from their ICU wards, with exact specifications of each unit provided before shipment
Great rebuttal by a Tesla owner to those calling for Autopilot to be disabled. Was written with zero input from us. 
New model for evolution of intelligent life suggests probable emergence 2 billion years ago near galactic center 
Next month is also when our Dragon spaceship docks with the Space Station for the first time. Major pucker factor...
Rocket booster reentry, landing burn &amp; leg deploy were good, but lost hull integrity right after splashdown (aka kaboom)
First 1000 Boring Company Flamethrowers being picked up today! 
Our custom 144 TOPS in-vehicle inference computer, where almost every TOP is useable &amp; optimized for NN, far exceeds anything else in volume production, giving you the hardware you need to run sophisticated nets
Congrats to @dmetcalf for being the first to drive a Tesla Model S over 400 miles on a single charge!

Tesla dual motor cars are also all-wheel drive. Main goal of dual motor was actually insane traction on snow. Insane speed was a side effect
Latest vertical landing rocket vid. 325M altitude, hold against wind, land w T/W&gt;1, radar in loop 
Will be live streaming the Gigafactory launch party tonight. Check  this eve.
Official Gigafactory address to be: Electric Avenue, McCarran, Nevada
Fixed. Now it's good.
Nothing can escape gravity, not even black holes (and they really tried!)
Duck emoji FTW
In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land &amp; not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY
Thud!

Data upload from tracking plane shows landing in Atlantic was good! Several boats enroute through heavy seas.
Really tempting to redesign upper stage for return too (Falcon Heavy has enough power), but prob best to stay focused on the Mars rocket
More Kerbal! 
Fate *loves* irony. Frankly, too much.

Tesla history trivia: we didn‚Äôt actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He‚Äôd originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later. 
Sounds like this might be a good time to unveil the new Dragon Mk 2 spaceship that @SpaceX has been working on w @NASA. No trampoline needed

Exciting to see all the new electric vehicles coming to market! We created Tesla to accelerate a sustainable future &amp; it‚Äôs happening! 
To be clear, Tesla is strongly in favor of people being allowed to drive their cars and always will be. Hopefully, that is obvious.
Only a matter of time before advanced AI is used to do this. Internet is particularly susceptible to a gradient descent algo.

Falcon 9 delivered Dragon to its target orbit. All good on the rocket.
Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
