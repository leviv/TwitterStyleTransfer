Cultivating a close, warmhearted feeling for others is the ultimate source of success in life.
When you find that all human beings are just like you, it fosters a spirit of friendship. You‚Äôll find there's less need to hide things, and as a result, feelings of fear, self-doubt, and insecurity are automatically dispelled. What‚Äôs more you‚Äôll earn the trust of other people.

Peace has a great deal to do with warm-heartedness and respect for the lives of others, avoiding doing them harm and regarding their lives as being as precious as our own. If, on that basis, we can also be of help to others, so much the better.

There is a link between our physical and verbal actions and emotions. If, instead of anger, hatred and suspicion, we are moved by loving-kindness, we will naturally have greater respect for others and our actions will be non-violent.
"kendo is so much better than normal swords" nope fuck yourself
Of the 7 billion human beings alive today, no one wants to suffer; no one chooses to have problems. Yet, many of the problems we face are our own creation. Why? Because of ignorance. But ignorance is not permanent and whether we overcome it depends on whether we make the effort.
Because anger and hostility destroy our peace of mind, it is they that are our real enemy. Anger ruins our health; a compassionate attitude restores it. If it were basic human nature to be angry, there‚Äôd be no hope, but since it is our nature to be compassionate, there is.

The greatest antidote to insecurity and the sense of fear is compassion - it brings one back to the basis of one's inner strength
Striving gradually to be more compassionate is to develop genuine sympathy for others‚Äô suffering and the will to help remove their pain.

Wrong! We have more cases because we have tested far more than any other country, 60,000,000. If we tested less, there would be less cases. How did Italy, France &amp; Spain do? Now Europe sadly has flare ups. Most of our governors worked hard &amp; smart. We will come back STRONG!  ::

HHDL marks International Non-Violence Day during his teachings in Dharamsala, India, on October 2. 
Because of MAIL-IN BALLOTS, 2020 will be the most RIGGED Election in our nations history - unless this stupidity is ended. We voted during World War One &amp; World War Two with no problem, but now they are using Covid in order to cheat by using Mail-Ins!
for the 9th time today a complete stranger has approached me on the street and told me to go suck some ass. "And still the brand endures"
If we cherish non-violence and concern for others‚Äô well-being it is possible to make this a more peaceful century.

True compassion isn‚Äôt an emotional response, but a firm commitment founded on reason: it won‚Äôt change if others behave negatively.

Let‚Äôs reflect on what gives meaning to our lives, and set our priorities on the basis of that. We need to be positive. We weren't born to cause trouble or to do harm to others. For life to be of value, we must develop basic good human qualities‚Äîwarmth, kindness, compassion.

Not only is it the case that happy people are more willing to help others, but as I generally point out, helping others is the best way to help yourself, the best way to promote your own happiness. It is you, yourself, who will receive the benefit.
Without a sense of equanimity, unbiased love and compassion cannot even get started.

Even more important than the warmth and affection we receive, is the warmth and affection we give. It is by giving warmth and affection, by having a genuine sense of concern for others, in other words through compassion, that we gain the conditions for genuine happiness.
Education needs to be combined with a sincere, compassionate motivation. When intelligence and warm-heartedness are combined, individuals will be happier and more at peace with themselves, their families will benefit and as a result the wider community will benefit too.
Thanks for the cool suggestions üòÄ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç More fun coming to your Tesla soon! 
Mentally and emotionally we humans are all the same. We can all feel anger and hatred, but also have the potential to cultivate compassion, forgiveness and tolerance. Since these constructive emotions are supported by reason, we can use our brains to develop and strengthen them.
Education today tends to focus on material goals. We seek sensory gratification in music or good things to look at, taste and touch. We may enjoy watching a game of sport, but once it ends the joy is over. What we really need is happiness that is rooted in the power of the mind.

Everybody appreciates kindness, but unfortunately our modern education system, with its materialistic goals, doesn‚Äôt have much room for inner values. We need to make people more aware of such inner values on the basis of scientific findings, common sense and common experience.

Religious people pray for peace, but prayer alone is not enough, what will bring peace in the world is people cultivating peace of mind.

Do not believe the Fake News Media. Oklahoma speech had the highest Saturday television ratings in @FoxNews history. @seanhannity dominated T.V. with my interview on Thursday night, more than @CNN &amp; MSDNC COMBINED. These are the real polls, the Silent Majority, not FAKE POLLS!

In today‚Äôs materialistic world there is a risk of people becoming slaves to money, as though they were simply cogs in a huge money-making machine. This does nothing for human dignity, freedom, and genuine well-being. Wealth should serve humanity, and not the other way around.

Taking care of our planet, is a matter of looking after our own home. We can no longer exploit the earth‚Äôs resources‚Äîthe trees, water, air and minerals‚Äîwith no care for the coming generations. I support young people‚Äôs protests at governments‚Äô inaction over the climate crisis.
To me, all these features that differentiate us, like wealth, position, status, and so on, are secondary. I truly believe we can learn to relate to one another on the basis of our shared humanity. And if individuals can learn to do that, there‚Äôll immediately be a basis for trust.

We may say prayers when we are trying to solve the problems we face, but it is up to us to put an end to violence and bring about peace. Creating peace is our responsibility. To pray for peace while still engaging in the causes that give rise to violence is contradictory.

All the positive states of mind such as love, compassion, insight and so on, have the quality that you can enhance their capacity and increase their potential to a limitless degree, if you regularly practice them through training and by developing constant familiarity with them.
HHDL sends his thanks for all the greetings and good wishes sent to him on his 80th birthday. 
Love and compassion benefit both ourselves and others. Through kindness to others, your heart and mind will be peaceful and open.

Once you realize that compassion is useful, that it is something really worthwhile, you immediately develop a willingness to cultivate it.
We have to learn how to use our time properly. It's important to make our lives meaningful. Bullying and cheating others may give a short-term return, but leaves a nagging sense of unease. Money doesn't yield real satisfaction, whereas compassion does.

The very purpose of spirituality is self-discipline. Rather than criticizing others, we should evaluate and criticize ourselves. Ask yourself, what am I doing about my anger, my attachment, my pride, my jealousy? These are the things we should check in our day to day lives.

The first drawback of anger is that it destroys our inner peace; the second is that it distorts our view of reality. If we think about this and come to understand that anger is really unhelpful, that it is only destructive, we can begin to distance ourselves from anger.

Love and compassion are qualities that human beings require just to live together.

If developing qualities like love, compassion, generosity and patience, is to be effective, we must put them into practice in our daily life

Compassion suits our physical condition, whereas anger, fear and distrust are harmful to our well-being. Therefore, just as we learn the importance of physical hygiene to physical health, to ensure healthy minds, we need to learn some kind of emotional hygiene.
All human beings have the capacity to be determined and to direct that determination in whatever direction they like. Realizing we have this potential gives us a fundamental strength, enabling us to deal with any difficulty, whatever situation we are facing, without losing hope.

Through constant training we can enhance our positive attitudes and thoughts and reduce their opposing negative attitudes.
If we find we cannot help others, the least we can do is to desist from harming them.
Anger can be reduced if we work to cultivate love and affection. However, we first have to come to terms with whatever benefits or disadvantages anger may bring. Primarily, anger destroys our peace of mind; loving-kindness earns us friends and eliminates the risk of being alone.

When we develop care and concern by thinking of others not as ‚Äòthem‚Äô but ‚Äòus‚Äô, there is no room for bullying, exploitation or deceit.
You‚Äôll see
The topic of compassion is not at all religious business; it is important to know it is human business, it is a question of human survival.
Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k.
The greatest threat we face today is violence.

His Holiness the Dalai Lama offers his condolences to those affected by the floods in Brazil. 
We need to make an effort to develop our inner values, irrespective of whether we are religious or not.
I believe the ultimate source of blessings is within us. A good motivation and honesty bring self-confidence, which attracts the trust and respect of others. Therefore the real source of blessings is in our own mind.
It is necessary to help others, not only in our prayers, but in our daily lives.
Genuine peace in the world depends on our having peace in our hearts. If we are full of anger how can we expect to bring about peace.
...Importantly, we also won on the Ballot Cure Provision. Waiting for the BIG Federal decisions in Pennsylvania, Nevada, and elsewhere! 
Among human beings trust comes about, not from expressions of wealth or fame, but from our showing affection.
In our day to day life warm-heartedness is the key factor for happiness.

What is important is not so much how long you live as whether you live a meaningful life. This doesn‚Äôt mean accumulating money and fame, but being of service to your fellow human beings. It means helping others if you can, but even if you can‚Äôt do that, at least not harming them.

We need to balance material and spiritual progress, acting with love and compassion can help achieve that balance.
We are intelligent, we have seed of compassion from birth. Using reason and intelligence we can enhance our sense of compassion and come to understand how its opposite, anger, is harmful.

Even our personal virtues, such as patience and our sense of ethics, are all developed in dependence upon others.

We have a marvellous brain, but have to use it properly. It's scientific to be sceptical, to research and experiment. An approach I admire.
Fundamentally human beings are the same. Imagine being lost in some remote place and suddenly seeing someone coming towards you over the horizon. You wouldn't care about their race, nationality or religious faith, you'd be filled with the joy of encountering another human being.

Moral ethics are not a matter of religion alone, a secular approach needs to given, so that they become more universal.
It‚Äôs not just money we need to lead a happy life; more important is to find inner peace.

Ethics are not a collection of commandments and prohibitions to abide by, but a natural inner offering that can bring happiness and satisfaction to ourselves and others.

Anger and aggression sometimes seem to be protective because they bring energy to bear on a particular situation, but that energy is blind. It takes a calm mind to be able to consider things from different angles and points of view.

All things originate in the mind. Actions and events depend heavily on motivation. Appreciation of humanity, compassion and love are key points. If we develop a good heart, whether our field is science, agriculture or politics, since motivation is so crucial, they‚Äôll all improve.

So hard to watch @FoxNews anymore. They are working so hard against the people (viewers) that got them there. Their contributors are a disaster, and all over the place. The Radical Left has scared Fox into submission, just like they have so many others. Sad, but we will WIN!

This is Fake News by the failing @nytimes &amp; bad ratings @CNN. Never suggested it although, based on all of the many things accomplished during the first 3 1/2 years, perhaps more than any other Presidency, sounds like a good idea to me! 
I don‚Äôt like formality. There‚Äôs no formality when we‚Äôre born and none when we die. In between we should treat each other as brothers and sisters because we all want to live a happy life. This is our common purpose and our right.
Our day-to-day existence is very much alive with hope, although there is no guarantee of our future. There is no guarantee that tomorrow at this time we will be here. But still we are working for that purely on the basis of hope. So, we need to make the best use of our time.
If we seek happiness for ourselves, we should practice compassion: and if we seek happiness for others, we should also practice compassion.

It is not enough simply to wish that love and compassion should increase in us, we need to make a sustained effort to cultivate them.

Seeing how negative emotions lead to negative consequences can help us overcome them. Just as we can learn how helpful love and compassion can be, we can come to understand that anger, pride, jealousy and arrogance can be detrimental. We need to use reason and human intelligence.
It is clear that feelings of love, affection, closeness and compassion bring happiness.
Nobody briefed or told me, @VP Pence, or Chief of Staff @MarkMeadows about the so-called attacks on our troops in Afghanistan by Russians, as reported through an ‚Äúanonymous source‚Äù by the Fake News @nytimes. Everybody is denying it &amp; there have not been many attacks on us.....

Many of the problems we face today are our own creation. Creating a more peaceful world requires a peaceful mind and a peaceful heart. As human brothers and sisters we must live together in tolerance and affection.
Compassion is something really worthwhile. It is not just a religious or spiritual subject, not a matter of ideology. It is not a luxury, it is a necessity.

Look at the world today‚Äîviolence is rife, weapons proliferate and countries eagerly pursue arms sales. This is a wrong approach. There are other ways to make money. The world needs non-violence and compassion, not in terms of prayers, but as spurs to a different course of action.
At the request of many great Americans who live in the Suburbs, and others, I am studying the AFFH housing regulation that is having a devastating impact on these once thriving Suburban areas. Corrupt Joe Biden wants to make them MUCH WORSE. Not fair to homeowners, I may END!
Compassion enhances our self-confidence because a calm mind allows our marvellous human intelligence to bloom. When we‚Äôre angry, our thinking is distorted and we don‚Äôt see the different aspects of reality. A calm mind enables us to take a broader, more realistic view.

Whatever you do, take a realistic view and think of the long term interests of humanity.
Even as our world continues to develop materially, there is increasing need for similar progress in our sense of inner values.
In order to lead a meaningful life, you need to cherish others, pay attention to human values and try to cultivate inner peace.
So great for the World! 
venus sucks shit. if they find life there it's going to be a very small man curled into the fetal position yelling "FUCK THIS"

Tesla Impact Report (repost). We do everything humanly possible to source materials &amp; produce sustainable energy cars, batteries &amp; solar ethically. Suggestions for improvement are always appreciated.  
Ultimately, the reason why love and compassion bring the greatest happiness is simply that our nature cherishes them above all else.

Young children are naturally honest, open and appreciate affection. Some scientists say that human beings are social animals with a natural concern for their own community. We see this among children. When they are young, they are naturally kind.
Time is always moving on; nothing can stop it. We can't change the past, but we can learn from it to shape the future. Stress on ‚Äòus‚Äô and ‚Äòthem‚Äô is a source of conflict. We neglect basic human qualities of kindness and compassion. Let‚Äôs work together to create a happier future.

We are tracking down the two Anarchists who threw paint on the magnificent George Washington Statue in Manhattan. We have them on tape. They will be prosecuted and face 10 years in Prison based on the Monuments and Statues Act. Turn yourselves in now!
Friendship depends on trust and trust depends on having a strong sense of concern for the welfare of others. Be honest, truthful and warm-hearted. Make compassion the basis of your determination. Think of what the future can be, not what happened in the past.

...and prices are coming down FAST! Also just ended all rebates to middlemen, further reducing prices.
A fundamentally positive approach is to take account of the oneness of humanity. Dividing the world into 'us' and 'them' might have worked in the past, but it doesn't any more. We have to talk through our problems with our opponents, thinking of them as our fellow human beings.
Cultivating love advances the wish that living beings deprived of happiness meet with happiness and its causes.

There is an urgent need for India‚Äôs traditions of non-violence and compassion in today‚Äôs world, which is still riven¬† by fighting and killing, sometimes even in the name of religion. We have the potential from birth to develop inner values like compassion that yield peace of mind
Material development only gives us sensory pleasure, but to be lastingly happy we need to develop our minds. We need calm minds.

Patience as we wait to take action is a kind of compassionate mind. Impatience on the other hand can be a source of failure.
Many of our world's problems and conflicts arise because we have lost sight of the basic humanity that binds us together as a human family.
the majority of my critics think its hould be illegal for me. or anyone else, to have a job.  Do not fall into their pranks.

True compassion is not just an emotional response, but a firm commitment founded on reason.
Tackling destructive emotions and practicing loving-kindness is how we should live in the here and now. I am convinced we can become happier individuals, happier communities and a happier humanity by cultivating a warm heart, allowing our better selves to prevail.

The practice of compassion and altruism brings us peace of mind. Even if we face trouble or someone is critical of something we‚Äôve said or done, compassion enables us to feel grateful to them. Compassion is the best counter measure to anger, anxiety and so forth.

Video of HHDL‚Äôs interview for KPBS in San Diego, California, recorded on April 19th, 2012. 
We need to strengthen such inner values as contentment, patience and tolerance, as well as compassion for others. Keeping in mind that it is expressions of affection rather than money and power that attract real friends, compassion is the key to ensuring our own well-being.
i would love to lift all of my pathetic, frail followers by the ankles and huck them like tomahawks
Within each of us exists the potential to contribute positively to society. Although one individual among so many on this planet may seem too insignificant, it is our personal efforts that will determine the direction our society is heading.
Thank you for the good reviews and comments on my interview with Chris Wallace of @FoxNews. We may have set a record for doing such an interview in the heat. It was 100 degrees, making things very interesting!
If we make a steady effort, I think we can overcome any form of negative conditioning and make positive changes in our lives.
me and this guy on a podcast talking about how its bull shit that youre not allowed to have opinions anymore 
suck off my ass
True compassion isn‚Äôt just an emotional response but a firm commitment founded on reason. Therefore, our compassion for others doesn‚Äôt change even if they behave negatively. Our sense of responsibility for others gives rise to a wish to help them actively overcome their problems.
Told you AI was dangerous!! üî•üí£üí¶ 
Even more important than the warmth and affection we receive, is the warmth and affection we give.
With the realization of ones own potential and self-confidence in ones ability, one can build a better world.

If a Republican LIED like Biden and Harris do, constantly, the Lamestream Media would be calling them out at a level never recorded before. For one year they called for No Fracking and big Tax Increases. Now they each say opposite. Fake News is working overtime!
Compassion is of little value if it just remains an idea. It must motivate how we respond to others and be reflected in all our thoughts and actions.

Joy and happiness are mental events and, according to our day to day experience, mental satisfaction is superior to physical pleasure. We need material development, but it‚Äôs a mistake to depend on material things alone to find happiness. We also need to be warm-hearted.
To the extent that suffering awakens our empathy and causes us to connect with others, it can serve as the basis of compassion and love.

Deep down we must have a real affection for each other, a clear recognition of our shared status as human beings.
In our modern society everything seems geared to material development, even our systems of education. As a result we no longer pay sufficient attention to our inner values, which leads to mental unrest. In order to address this imbalance we need to pay more attention to our minds

If you develop a pure and sincere motivation, if you are motivated by a wish to help on the basis of kindness, compassion, and respect, then you can carry on any kind of work, in any field, and function more effectively.
All good qualities must be sown and cultivated. We can‚Äôt expect to change overnight from an ordinary person into one with high realizations.
No matter what our motivation may be, if we are not realistic we will not fulfil our goal.
Whether we are happy or not depends on our attitude; compassion, for instance, leads to a calmer mind.

Some people consider the practice of love and compassion is only related to religious practice and if they are not interested in religion they neglect these inner values. But love and compassion are qualities that human beings require just to live together.
To make this a century of dialogue we need to find ways to promote a greater awareness of the oneness of humanity.
Genuine friendship depends on genuine affection and taking a sense of responsibility for each other.

By being inattentive to the needs of others, inevitably we end up harming them.

I feel that the moment you adopt a sense of caring for others, it brings you inner strength.

When our intentions toward others are good, we find that any feelings of anxiety or insecurity we may have are greatly reduced. We experience a liberation from our habitual preoccupation with self and paradoxically, this gives rise to strong feelings of confidence.

As a human brother I'm committed to letting people know that we all possess the seeds of love and compassion.
As a human being I‚Äôm aware that we are all physically, mentally and emotionally the same and we all want to live a happy life. Scientists say our basic nature is compassionate. It‚Äôs clear that love and affection bring people together.

From adversity we can learn the value of patience.
Even more important than the warmth and affection we receive, is the warmth and affection we give. It is by giving warmth and affection, by having a genuine sense of concern for others, in other words through compassion, that we gain the conditions for genuine happiness.
Welcome @hiromichimizuno to the Tesla board! Honored to have you.
I‚Äôm optimistic, the future is open: peace, reconciliation, compassion, the environment ‚Äì we have better awareness of these realities.
For many people, the only tangible value is money. And of course money has its place, but the value of cultivating a compassionate attitude is much more effective. When we only pay attention to material values, there‚Äôs little room for concern for others, or for mutual regard.

We can achieve peace of mind if we tackle our destructive emotions, so the goal of making the 21st century an era of peace and compassion is feasible. It will involve finding solutions to problems in dialogue, not the use of force.

Non-violence is a sign of strength, self-confidence and truth.
Peace in the world depends on peace within. If we have that we can approach problems in a spirit of compassion, dialogue and respect for the rights of others‚Äîalways a better solution than resorting to a use of weapons and force. External disarmament depends on inner disarmament.
We must cultivate a universal responsibility toward each other and extend it to the planet that we have to share.

All human endeavor is potentially great and noble - so long as we carry out our work with good motivation.

In general I think that anger is a sign of weakness and tolerance a sign of strength.
When individuals are too self-centred, they tend to be prone to fear, suspicion, anxiety and anger. Compassion and restraining from harming others, act as an antidote to this. Scientists say that it is basic human nature to be compassionate, because we are social animals.
