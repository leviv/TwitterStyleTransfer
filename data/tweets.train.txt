Today, I’m proud to endorse even more Democratic candidates who aren’t just running against something, but for something—to expand opportunity for all of us and to restore dignity, honor, and compassion to public service. They deserve your vote: 
Democrats cannot use “illegitimate” as a synonym for “we didn’t get our way.”  Democrats keep demanding the President repeat that the election will be valid even if he dislikes the outcome. But they're flunking that test badly with Judge Barrett's nomination.

In moments of crisis, we look out for one other. And we need leaders with empathy who will bring people together rather than drive them apart. @JoeBiden has the character and experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery.

The Senate is building on the action we took last week to restore some reason and sanity to the nominations process. Now we are confirming more of the President’s well-qualified nominees.
Remember Munich 
Donald Trump ran for office saying he would represent the forgotten men and women of this country — and as soon as he got in office, he forgot about us.
Perspective | Yes, the Senate is rigged for small states. But not for Republicans. 
One enormous, major lesson that I hope people realize in this moment:  Resistance to revolutionary policy was never really about a lack of money, or capacity, or logistics.  It was always about power and a lack of political will.
What is becoming clearer each hour is that record numbers of Americans — from all races, faiths, regions — chose change over more of the same.   They have given us a mandate for action on COVID and the economy and climate change and systemic racism.

"It's like walking into Chernobyl without any gear.”  I’m demanding better for our healthcare workers. Every worker deserves paid sick leave, full personal protective equipment, and hazard pay NOW. 
The #TrumpBudget is an attack on the good health, financial security and well-being of the American people. Tune in at 12:15 pm ET as @SenSchumer and I discuss its broken promises to hard-working families. 
It is a pleasure to welcome Prime Minister @LeoVaradkar to the U.S. Capitol for the Friends of Ireland Luncheon. 
Because of the public-private parternship forged by President @realDonaldTrump, we are on track to produce 110,000 ventilators in 100 days. It’s nothing short of a National accomplishment that no one in America who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. 
We won’t see bold, transformative change without building a multi-racial grassroots coalition — that’s why I’m proud to work with @PplsAction as we fight for justice through a #HomesGuarantee, #Medicare4All, and other people-first policies.  
Rent and mortgage payments are due in a few days, as 870,000 workers are filing for unemployment.  People need relief. Cancel it.

I don’t agree with Al Sharpton on much, but he is spot on here. 
In this moment, we're facing both a public health crisis and an economic crisis because Donald Trump failed to do his job. I'm in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, to discuss what I'll do to get our nation back on track. Tune in. 
Sign up now for a free trial of @SIRIUSXM to hear me on @sternshow @HowardStern this morning! 
A slight change of tone from the president for one night doesn’t cover up the lies he told. It doesn’t change the fact that over 220,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 on his watch.  We can’t take another four years of Donald Trump’s failed leadership.
.@JoeBiden has a plan to build our country back better and create millions of jobs—jobs that can help working families get ahead. Joe helped manage the Recovery Act, which jumpstarted the longest stretch of job growth in our history. And he’ll do it again.

SNAP is our country’s most effective anti-hunger initiative. The USDA’s cynical new rule does nothing to close the income inequality gap and instead threatens to take food away from millions of Americans. House Democrats will not be silent. #HandsOffSNAP

'Something Has To Give': Latinas Leaving Workforce At Faster Rate Than Other Groups 
President Trump’s insulting comments about our men and women in uniform are appalling. Our military deserves a Commander-in-Chief who respects their service. Clearly, Trump does not.

Now is not the time for a victory lap, Mr. President. Just because your wealthy friends and donors are doing well doesn't mean everyone else is.  Get off the golf course. Call the leaders of Congress to the White House. And make a deal that delivers for working people.

Change happens because people like you fight to make it happen. 
While other nations worked around the clock to get this virus under control, our president was too busy tweeting and golfing.  Now, nearly 200,000 Americans have died.  It didn’t have to happen this way. 
If we give Donald Trump another four years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.  We can’t let that happen.

Toni Morrison was a national treasure, as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. Her writing was a beautiful, meaningful challenge to our conscience and our moral imagination. What a gift to breathe the same air as her, if only for a while.

Over-policing our schools doesn’t make them safer — it criminalizes Black and brown students. That’s why I just introduced legislation with @AyannaPressley, @ewarren, and @ChrisMurphyCT to replace police officers in schools with mental health professionals to support students.

Senate Republicans proposed a major rescue package: A trillion dollars for kids, jobs, and healthcare. But Democrats are blocking it all. The American people need a bipartisan outcome, not Democrats’ stonewalling behind closed doors.
Not to be outdone: SCHUMER compared them to dogs -- “a golden retriever can’t mate with a Chihuahua. You have a Chihuahua. We have a beautiful lion,” he said, according to multiple people in the room.

Federal, state, and local officials in Kentucky are working overtime together to assist those in need. And citizens across the Commonwealth are stepping up and finding creative ways to pitch in and help others.  United we stand, divided we fall. 
The Senate will soon have to address some of the deepest institutional questions contemplated by our Constitution. We’ll have to decide whether we are going to safeguard core governing traditions or let short-term partisan rage overcome them.

Wear a mask.  
Yes. Many who’ve never had to deal with the consequences of such rhetoric think objecting to the President’s racism is about “political correctness.”  Really, it’s about protecting the millions of people who’ve become more vulnerable to hate crimes as a result of such language.

We have no idea how many people in the US are living in poverty.  That’s bc the “poverty line” doesn’t measure true poverty at all.  Our Recognize Poverty Act directs the gov to actually find out how many Americans are struggling.  Ask yourself why there’s resistance to doing so. 
This news is deeply disturbing — as an alum of @UDelaware and as an American. We need a full and swift investigation into what happened Tuesday night.   With anti-Semitism on the rise across the country, we all have a moral obligation to speak out and give hate no safe harbor.

1/x Everyone agrees Tuesday’s debate was a train wreck. A major contributing fact was the moderator Chris Wallace, a registered Democrat, repeatedly interrupting to try to help Joe Biden. The next debate is set to be moderated by a former intern to...Joe Biden. (And Ted Kennedy.)
Democrats have been working to build an economy that works for workers since Day One. This week, we build on that progress by passing the #PROAct, to protect the rights of workers to join a union. 
3/x Why should the false revisionist history not be used as the basis of K-12 education across the nation? Not because of “cancel culture,” which you support.   But because it wrong &amp; deliberately deceptive. As your former board member put it, “history itself is one more...”
Material development is important, but it only provides physical comfort. Peace of mind contributes to good health. Families that are moved by kindness, whether rich or poor, are happy; whereas those that are rich, but lacking in kindness and affection are unhappy.
Where Joe Biden actually said “Yes, absolutely” when asked if he’d support cutting funding to law enforcement, under President @realDonaldTrump we will always BACK THE BLUE and we’re not going to defund the police—not now, not ever!
I will save your a Second Amendment, Virginia. He is going to take it away. Vote Trump!

Being too self-centred can give rise to anxiety and depression. An effective antidote is to cultivate a sense of altruism, taking the whole of humanity into account. Appreciating the oneness of humanity leads us to recognise our essential equality as human beings.

Our real enemies and the enemies of humanity are negative emotions like anger and hatred. Indeed, people who are dominated by powerful negative emotions should be objects of our compassion.
Leadership requires foresight.

Joe Biden actually said America is “systemically racist,” and police have an “implicit bias” against minorities. When asked if he’d support cutting funding for law enforcement he said, “Yes, absolutely.”

If you’re angry and resentful it’s like being part of a chain reaction; forgiveness puts a stop to anger, ill-will and a desire for revenge.
If developing qualities like love, compassion, generosity and patience, is to be effective, we must put them into practice in our daily life

Contrary to Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders’ radical agenda, President @realDonaldTrump is rebuilding this economy based on freedom, free markets, and the rule of law. Their agenda is based on government control and our agenda is based on FREEDOM. 
Warm-heartedness reinforces our self-confidence – giving us not a blind confidence, but a sense of confidence based on reason.
Sometimes it takes the wisdom and resilience of those who have been marginalized for all of us to remember the importance of community and mutual aid.

President @realDonaldTrump &amp; the entire Admin are pleased at the passage of the Paycheck Protection Program in the House. It includes support for working families, the ability for small businesses to keep their workers on the payroll &amp; $75B to assist hospitals across the Country.

2: Who will validate that the Administration’s decision to greenlight a COVID-19 vaccine is driven by science and not political motivation?   We must hear uncensored statements on efficacy and safety from @FDACBER, the @US_FDA vaccine advisory committee, and Dr. Fauci.
With Joe Biden’s economic policies, America would lose 5 MILLION jobs &amp; income for American families would drop by $6,500 a year. We have a choice to make. It’s between a Trump BOOM or a Biden downturn &amp; the choice is clear, we need four more years of President @realDonaldTrump!

Congrats to the @Lakers and @Seattlestorm on their championship wins! Proud of all the NBA and WNBA teams and players who've been using their platforms to take a stand for racial justice and encourage civic participation this season.
We're just getting started.   Outwork. Out-organize. Outlast. 
House Democrats continue to play political games with their partisan impeachment of the commander-in-chief. Even with a process this constitutionally serious, even with tensions rising in the Middle East, House Democrats are treating impeachment like a political toy. 
Me too 
Struggling Americans need action now. I am glad that President Trump is proving that while Democrats use laid-off workers as political pawns, Republicans will actually look out for them. My full statement:

Time’s always moving on; nothing can stop it. We can’t change the past, but we can still learn from it. And we can shape the future, creating a more peaceful era, by adopting a realistic approach, recognising that the more compassionate you are, the more you’ll find inner peace.
Today, every Senator will be able to take a clear moral stand. We’ll have the chance to proceed to two commonsense pieces of legislation that would move our nation closer to the international mainstream with respect to defending innocent human life.

To promote the idea of nonviolence, we must above all encourage people to foster in themselves an attitude of love and affection for others.
The practice of compassion and altruism brings us peace of mind. Even if we face trouble or someone is critical of something we’ve said or done, compassion enables us to feel grateful to them. Compassion is the best counter measure to anger, anxiety and so forth.

Beyond satire.   Twitter is literally censoring the President of the United States for saying that violent anarchists will not be allowed to take over our nation’s capital &amp; that law enforcement will act to protect public safety.  In Big Tech’s Orwellian world, that’s “abusive.”

No amount of attacks from the president or his campaign or even his Wall Street donors will stop or distract us from fiercely fighting for the people of the Fifth. That’s a promise. 
In 2016 &amp; ‘17, I paid thousands of dollars a year in taxes *as a bartender.*  Trump paid $750.  He contributed less to funding our communities than waitresses &amp; undocumented immigrants.  Donald Trump has never cared for our country more than he cares for himself. A walking scam. 
But of course. 
.@RepValDemings gets to the heart of the issue: the President placed his own political interests above our national interests, our national security, and our Constitution. The witnesses today saw the pressure campaign up close, and they had no doubt. #DefendOurDemocracy

One of the worst polls in 2016 was the @FoxNews Poll. They were so ridiculously wrong. Fox said they were going to change pollsters, but they didn’t. They totally over sample Democrats to a point that a child could see what is going on. Rasmussen, which was accurate, at 52%.

Sadly, Democrats began attacking the JUSTICE Act proposal before it was even released.   The Senate has recently put division aside to produce major bipartisan bills like the CARES Act and the Great American Outdoors Act. Police reform needs that same spirit. I hope we see it.
Irrespective of whether we have faith in religion or not, it’s good to be more compassionate. It makes us happier as individuals with a positive influence on our families and the neighborhood where we live.

I wish we knew his name simply because we were celebrating what he meant to his students, his daughter, his family.  He was a community builder.  And we were robbed of his life.  Let us define him by how he lived. A letter from one of his students: 
I was in that CBP facility. There were cameras and monitors everywhere. Are we really supposed to believe that every single camera and every single feed in the detention center happened to go offline the day that I and an entire Congressional delegation visited?  I don’t.
Few know more about our education system than @BobbyScott. When he says schools won’t be able to protect students, staff &amp; families w/o significant federal funding, it must be taken seriously. The @SenateGOP must work with us to deliver for communities nationwide. #HeroesAct 
He arrived in the Senate when I was 2 years old.

We should be boosting pay and benefits for the people who provide food for our families — not endangering their livelihoods. 
There are two possibilities:  (1) Dan Rather, for decades CBS’s lead news anchor, doesn’t know what court “packing” (increasing—as FDR tried to do—SCOTUS from 9 Justices to a larger number, for political benefit) is; or   (2) he’s intentionally lying.   Which one is it? 🤔

Yesterday I signed four measures that will massively reduce the prices of prescription drugs, in many cases by more than 50%. Nothing like this has ever been done before because Big Pharma, with its vast power, would not let it happen. Expensive Insulin went from big dollars.....
Rent doesn’t wait on Congress.  I understand the idea of an “interim” patch bill, but if Congress doesn’t know when it will next convene, we need to vote on a bigger fix now.  We need WAY more for PPP, $2000 monthly cash payments (plus $1k for each child), &amp; cover health bills.
I don’t like formality. There’s no formality when we’re born and none when we die. In between we should treat each other as brothers and sisters because we all want to live a happy life. This is our common purpose and our right.
Even today, the Speaker and her allies keep contradicting themselves. They say their case is already “overwhelming,” “beyond any reasonable doubt.” But they also keep asking the Senate to re-do their homework and add to the investigation that House Democrats rushed to close.
Given his track record, no one can take Trump’s word alone on a COVID-19 vaccine. But with satisfactory answers to these questions, every American can have confidence in a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine.

The Senate is focused on wrapping up this year’s remaining priorities: getting more of the president’s team in place, confirming well-qualified nominees to our federal courts, and attending to the pressing legislative business the American people expect us to handle.

Our country badly needs the kinds of targeted, urgent COVID relief that Republicans have been trying to pass for months — from job-saving PPP funding to vaccine distribution.   My full statement: 
“10:00PM CT" 
Fear and anxiety easily give way to anger and violence. The opposite of fear is trust, which, related to warm-heartedness, boosts our self-confidence. Compassion also reduces fear, reflecting as it does a concern for others’ well-being. This is what really attracts friends.

Once you realize that compassion is useful, that it is something really worthwhile, you immediately develop a willingness to cultivate it.
Nineteen years ago, thousands of Americans were murdered by terrorists. National landmarks burned. Brave first responders put their lives on the line to save strangers.   May we never fail to honor them. And may we never tire of our pledge: Never Again. 
On every single promise made to the people of Ohio, President @realDonaldTrump DELIVERED. We have cut taxes, roll back red tape, created millions of jobs, and unleashed American energy!

Lindsey Graham suddenly believes in debt forgiveness when it comes to US debt to China, yet refuses to consider cancelling or even AUDITING Puerto Rico’s *illegal* debt made by Wall St vulture funds.  Or even student loans!  Classic GOP: “bootstraps for thee, bailouts for me.”

And now, as then, we owe it to them to come together as a nation — so that Americans can once again do what we did so bravely nineteen years ago: turn from tragedy to purpose, rebuild our lives, and begin, in time, to heal.
Our National Day of Prayer certainly comes at the right time this year. Let’s pray for everyone who is sick and suffering with the coronavirus, struggling with unemployment and isolation, or working on the front lines to care for strangers and keep our nation going.

The unrelenting impact of climate change affects every single one of us.  It requires action, not denial. It requires leadership, not scapegoating.  It requires a president to meet the threshold duty of the office — to care, for everyone.
When the President said ‘when the looting starts, the shooting starts’ this is the kind of rhetoric he’s normalizing.  And while Trump and his party own these threats, and the violence that comes with them, the worst part is they *know* they do.   And they don't care.

The major need that hospitals across the country are echoing: PPE supplies and equipment.  COVID is set to spike. There aren’t enough masks, gloves, ventilators, beds, etc to treat people.  Trump needed to order mass production over a week ago to save lives.  He didn’t.

The Senate’s abdication of responsibility to the rule of law represents a much deeper threat to our democracy, our institutions, and our republic.  The GOP knows that its agenda is incompatible with democracy, so their larger project is to dismantle it.

Conservatives on the Supreme Court intervened to steal an election in 2000.   Republicans in the Senate then intervened to prevent a Democrat from filling a seat on that court in 2016.   It has always been about the raw exercise of power over others, never about democracy.

This is shameful. America shouldn’t have a wealth test for admission. It’s a place where millions of people are descendants of immigrants who came w nothing &amp; made a life.  The American Dream isn’t a private club with a cover charge - it’s the possibility of remaking your future. 
The 19th amendment is the legacy of all those who marched and organized for transformational legislative change. Progress isn’t about just politics or protest––it’s about both. 100 years later, we’re all so much better off because of their commitment. 
.@VALLINIAndre @fhollande This is great news! Looking forward to it!
Rumors are rumors but sexual abuse is something I don’t take lightly. I wanted to speak out right away but out of respect to so many victims who deal with these issues daily I wanted to make sure I gathered the facts before I made any statement.
From kindergarten onwards we need education to strengthen inner values not just pursue material goals. We need to introduce emotional hygiene, much as we teach physical hygiene. This way we can address the problems we face, in the hope of making this a century of non-violence.

The same Washington D.C. “experts” who brought us Obamacare’s sky-high premiums, deductibles, out-of-pocket costs, and dysfunction now want to hollow out Medicare and create a government-run plan that every single American would be forced into.
It’s not just a matter of long lines either - in this year’s primary, thousands of voters received their mail-in ballots *after* the election. In 2017, the NYC Board of Elections admitted in court it broke state &amp; fed law by purging hundreds of thousands of voters off the rolls.

We cut through red tape making it possible for patients with life-threatening infections from Coronavirus to receive plasma. Thanks to President @realDonaldTrump's leadership, America is leading in the rapid development of safe &amp; effective treatments for Coronavirus.
John Hume’s deep conviction in the power of dialogue and negotiations to resolve conflict was unwavering. It was his leadership and his faith in the power of negotiations that enabled the 1998 Good Friday Agreement to be reached — an example for us all. 
If you’re wondering whether it’s an overreaction to cancel large gatherings and public events (and I love basketball), here’s a useful primer as to why these measures can slow the spread of the virus and save lives. We have to look out for each other.

Ultimately, it’s going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times. But I want to highlight some basic lessons from past efforts that are worth remembering:
There will be no split, as they are already measuring for curtains: Democrats are split over ending the filibuster, as they seek to regain control of the Senate and White House  via @WSJ
Underinvestment across the board. Some campaigns spent $0 on digital the week before the election. Others who spent did so in very poor ways.  If I spent only $12k on TV the week before an election &amp; then blamed others after, you’d ask questions. That’s how it looks seeing this.

Agree. Naming a team after “Washington, DC” is really toxic.

Hello, Wisconsin! Great to be here with @RepBryanSteil and @RepGrothman! 
The fact of the matter is Donald Trump doesn't have a health care plan.  I do — and you can read it here:  
I’m really proud of @JulianCastro and his campaign.  He ran with true purpose and intentionality. His team uplifted important conversations and took on issues that most candidates shy away from.  At their best, campaigns can be acts of service. Julián’s campaign exemplified that. 
Every day that Republicans’ anti-health care lawsuit is allowed to endure is a day that American families will be forced to live in uncertainty &amp; fear. Unless the USSC acts, families will continue to face needless disruption in their coverage &amp; premiums.

I am proud of the work our government has done to shore up our defenses of American democracy and deter foreign interference. I'm glad the administration is laser-focused on continuing the progress. Our adversaries aren’t letting up and our preparations are not letting up either.
Throughout history, opponents of progress have said our dreams were “unrealistic.”  They said it about Women’s Rights. They said it about Civil Rights. They said it about Medicare.  It is up to us to determine what is realistic. When we fight for meaningful change, we achieve it.

It’s safe to say the President is getting more cooperation from Mexico than he is out of Congressional Democrats. We wanted to set aside $5 billion weeks ago to deal with the humanitarian crisis at the border, but Democrats insisted on stripping it out.

The President has been impeached, and that is forever.   He was frivolous with the Constitution, the Senate should not be. #DefendOurDemocracy

NYPD union endorsed Trump. I’m sure this is part of their neighborhood outreach plan.  Also, does anyone else see a potential problem with police unions - enforcement arms of the state with lethal weapons - promoting “preferred” candidates for office or is that just me? 
The President ran on banning people from the country based solely on their Muslim faith.   This man has no right to lecture anyone about respecting people’s faith.  PS not all people of faith believe the government should make decisions over what women do with their bodies.

The Trump admin is now projecting 3,000 daily deaths by June, and they are STILL pushing to “reopen.”  We are now careening towards one 9/11-scale death event *per day.* This was all preventable w/ tests, tracing,&amp; policy.  Instead the GOP showered their friends w/ bailout money.
It remains beyond reasonable dispute that Judge Kavanaugh’s legal brilliance and excellence on the bench make him one of the very most qualified Supreme Court nominees in memory.

But @KamalaHarris and Senate Democrats blocked a mainly bipartisan police reform bill - refusing to even debate and vote on it!  I guess they wanted the issue for their campaign and are not interested in addressing racial injustice after all. @SenatorTimScott #JUSTICEAct 
Republicans have created a serious framework. The question is whether Democrats will come to the table in good faith. In March, when they did, we passed the CARES Act unanimously. In June, when they didn’t, police reform collapsed.  It will take bipartisanship to make law.

President Trump’s fear tactics have one goal: to convince Americans not to exercise their right to vote. Do not listen to him. Do not let him succeed. @thebeatwithari #DontMessWithUSPS

I’ve dealt with guys like Donald Trump my whole life.  Guys who look down on you because they’ve got a lot of money.  Guys who think they’re better than you.  Guys who inherited everything they ever got in life — and then squandered it. 
Clean funding for worker pay in a crisis should not be controversial. I hope our Democratic colleagues will let Congress act this week. American workers deserve paychecks, not pink slips caused by political games.

When I won in 2018, many dismissed our victory as a “fluke.”  Our win was treated as an aberration, or bc my opponent “didn’t try.”  So from the start, tonight’s race was important to me.  Tonight we are proving that the people’s movement in NY isn’t an accident. It‘s a mandate.

Now that Biden’s Polls are dropping fast, he has agreed to get out of his basement and start campaignin,“in ten days.” Sadly, that is a very slow reaction time for a President. Our beloved USA needs a much faster, smarter, and tougher response than that. Get out there today, Joe!

One major reason I support Bernie is his consistency when things are hard.  Not only does Bernie reject corporate money in 2020, he’s also never taken corporate lobbyist money in his *entire political career.*  He is a real one. And in politics, that is nearly impossible to find. 
I hope people realize that the same Republicans who are refusing to acknowledge the results of our elections also champion disastrous foreign policy claiming they’re “bringing democracy” to other nations.

Wrong! We have more cases because we have tested far more than any other country, 60,000,000. If we tested less, there would be less cases. How did Italy, France &amp; Spain do? Now Europe sadly has flare ups. Most of our governors worked hard &amp; smart. We will come back STRONG!  ::

The President’s abuse of power undermined our national security and jeopardized the integrity of our elections. His actions are in defiance of both the vision of our founders and his own oath of office.

The irony of worrying about people turning America into Somalia, while allowing Trump to do literally what Somali dictators used to do.  Wake up, he is destroying everything that sets up apart.  We send election observers into other countries, we shouldn’t need ours monitored.

So now the Democrats are using Mail Drop Boxes, which are a voter security disaster. Among other things, they make it possible for a person to vote multiple times. Also, who controls them, are they placed in Republican or Democrat areas? They are not Covid sanitized. A big fraud!

To every American affected by the opioid epidemic, more help is on the way. 
The Senate is going to vote on the House’s proposal. I will support it. But it does not help enough Americans and, crucially, it adds even more uncertainty for small businesses. It will make it all the more urgent for the Senate to pass bold legislation to help small businesses.

H.R. 1 is the far left’s sprawling effort to seize more control of the political process. It’s an attempt to rewrite the rules of American politics to benefit the Democrats and their friends. 
Let’s reflect on what gives meaning to our lives, and set our priorities on the basis of that. We need to be positive. We weren't born to cause trouble or to do harm to others. For life to be of value, we must develop basic good human qualities—warmth, kindness, compassion.

Keith Ellison is MN Attorney General for god’s sake. The American electorate isn’t as scared of progressives as you’ll think. They just don’t like people who aren’t authentic &amp; can’t be trusted to fight for them.  This is why Keith won, the people knew he would be on their side.

Yesterday, Joe Biden said “I am not banning fracking.” Perhaps he’s forgotten his own words. At one of his rallies, he told a supporter: “I guarantee, I guarantee, we are going to end fossil fuels.” Joe, that includes fracking.

By learning to be more warm-hearted we can create a more compassionate world.
Some people mistakenly conclude that cultivating compassion is all about others’ benefit, whereas the first benefit is to us. Compassion brings us peace of mind. It attracts friends. Friends are based on trust and trust develops when we show concern for others.
What we must do – what science tells us we must do – is focus on expanding testing &amp; contact tracing. That is the only way we can safely reopen our economy. #AMR #FamiliesFirst 
Since universal compassion involves gradually expanding one’s circle of concern to the whole of humanity, it needs constant cultivation.

Indeed, the Governor is remarkably frank about this: In his judgment laundry and liquor, travel and tools, are all “essential” while traditional religious exercises are not. That is exactly the kind of discrimination the First Amendment forbids.”

Americans on both sides of the debate last week spoke up in a civil, respectful way, and our nation was better for it. But only one side was happy to play host to toxic- fringe behavior. And only one side’s leaders are calling for more of it. 
Donald Trump said he didn't want to tell the truth and create a panic. So he did nothing and created a disaster.

The President incites violence, inspires white-supremacist shooters, and his failed COVID response is costing thousands of lives per day. When you look at the world right now, ask yourself: Do you feel safe in Trump’s America?

Two major economic actions we should take to stabilize working families:  1. Get checks into everyone’s hands NOW. We can tax it back next year from the privileged who don’t need it.  2. Stop the money OUT. Suspend all major bill payments including mortgages, rent, loans, etc.

Any idea that concern for others, though a noble quality, is a matter for our private lives only, is simply short sighted. Compassion belongs to every sphere of activity, including, of course, the workplace.

President Trump’s actions prove that he still does not grasp the gravity of the coronavirus crisis, even as America passes the tragic milestone of more than 6 million COVID-19 cases nationwide. #FamiliesFirst  
10 million people *that we know of* are newly unemployed in the US.  This is an unprecedented crisis.  The Federal gov has the power to guarantee healthcare, housing, &amp; basic income.   Yet conservative officials are resisting doing the bare minimum to save lives. It’s a betrayal.

Senate Democrats just blocked urgent money for a popular, bipartisan job-saving program which they themselves literally coauthored with us two weeks ago. I complimented both sides and asked to increase the dollar amount without changing anything else. But they blocked it. 
Two hundred and thirty-three years ago today, our Founders completed what, for them, was the work of a nation, but, for humanity, a work for the ages: the Constitution of the United States of America.

Congress has provided more than $3 trillion in #COVID19 relief, but after speaking with countless Texans I know how critical it is to get more relief passed. That’s what we tried to do yesterday with The Continuing Paycheck Protection Act, but Democrats blocked it. 
Notwithstanding the scheduled state work period, the Senate will be in session next week. I am glad talks are ongoing between the Administration and Speaker Pelosi. I hope Congress can pass bipartisan legislation to continue combating the coronavirus and keep our economy strong.

There’s a fact of life here in the United States Senate: It takes 60 votes to legislate. So the American people cannot get any of the additional relief that Republicans want to give them unless Democrats will come to the table.
Just a friendly reminder: @AOC isn’t the enemy or a threat, she is an asset to our party.  When you allow the GOP to dictate who should be included in our “big tent” party, we all lose.  For god’s sake, the GOP has QAnon members in their ranks and won’t throw them under the bus.

Donald Trump is running TV ads taking Dr. Fauci out of context and without his permission.  So, here’s a message from the President in his own words. 
 😁
Donald Trump’s premature claims of victory are illegitimate, dangerous, and authoritarian.  Count the votes. Respect the results.
The House voted to send a 2nd stimulus check *2 mos ago* &amp; Senate Republicans haven’t even discussed it.  For a party that pretends to care abt hard work, they are the laziest leaders in COVID.  Even House GOP work harder, &amp; they don’t even read bills.  GET TO WORK @senatemajldr 
Democrats’ latest spin: They’ve moved from a $3.5 trillion, far-left, non-COVID-related wish list to a $2.5 trillion, far-left, non-COVID-related wish list and insist the White House meet them there.  That’s not a reality-based negotiation. It’s throwing spaghetti at the wall.

The developments of this Senate relief bill are concerning.  We are hearing lots of vague statements, but not a single member of Congress has seen actual bill text.  It seems to give a *HALF TRILLION DOLLARS* away to big corporations, w/ few worker protections.  Half a trillion.

This phrase is spoken during markups, which are different from hearings. In markups, members are debating the actual written substance of legislation - be it a bill, or (in this case) articles.  “Strike the last word” means you’re adding a pro forma amendment &amp; using it to talk.

Along the way, what the American people saw was a President who was projecting the kind of leadership and the kind of confidence in the American people and all of our healthcare experts, doctors and nurses that you would expect from a President in a challenging time like this. 
It was sad to see some Senate Democrats rush to blame our own administration before even knowing the facts. Rush to split hairs about intelligence before being briefed on it. Rush to downplay Soleimani’s evil while presenting our own president as the villain.
I feel that it’s crucial to have a clear recognition of the value of your objective. That's the important thing. Recognizing that your objective is worthy, because it involves others' welfare or the general well-being of the community, gives you the determination to pursue it.

Meditation is about keeping the mind clear; thinking deeply about reality. It’s about thinking about our emotions, asking ourselves ‘Why do I feel angry?’ and coming to understand the advantages and sound basis of positive emotions like warm-heartedness.

Republicans are mad at this when they literally just voted to do just this in March.  The reason they’re opposed to it now is because last time they got a Wall Street bailout and this time all that’s left is helping working people, the disabled, the poor, etc.
Donald Trump knew.  He lied to us for months.  And while a deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job — on purpose.  It was a life or death betrayal of the American people.

It is completely wrong for the BOE to cancel New York’s Presidential Primary.  This decision is not informed by public health: the state is still holding elections for every other seat that day, &amp; so far the only way your ballot will 100% be counted in NY is to vote in person! 
Disturbing. 
It is also a truly embarrassing indictment of what’s considered “center” politics in the US that objecting to the appointment of an official who helped cover up the murder of a Black child is deemed the “progressive, far left” position. 
No, it’s cuz of this:  
The House cannot choose our impeachment managers until we know what sort of trial the Senate will conduct.  President Trump blocked his own witnesses and documents from the House, and from the American people, on phony complaints about the House process. What is his excuse now?
This week, the senate is considering several important tax treaties with foreign trading partners. These treaties account for trillions of dollars in foreign investments across the country, cultivate robust trading relationships and create certainty for job creators.

You do not need to, nor should you, ignore your fears - there is plenty to be afraid of - but we have possibilities before us.  We can win, we can succeed, but we cannot do it alone. We will need the people.  We must get to work. Everyone matters. Everyone has something to give.

Nobody should be forced to sleep outside in this country, and the way we fix it is by guaranteeing housing to everyone - not with violence. Punishing people for having nowhere else to go is unconscionable. It’s cruel. And it’s not who we are.

We’re not going to “build America back better” with more government, higher taxes, more regulation, more liberal policies. We’re going to build America back better, stronger and more prosperous by doing again what President @realDonaldTrump and I did in our first 3 years.

We may say prayers when we are trying to solve the problems we face, but it is up to us to put an end to violence and bring about peace. Creating peace is our responsibility. To pray for peace while still engaging in the causes that give rise to violence is contradictory.
One side is handling these sensitive matters with dignity, with professionalism… by the book. And we have another side that chose to sit on allegations and keep them secret until they were leaked to the press.
In our world today, everyone wants to live a happy life and indeed everyone has a right to a happy life. Yet we face problems, many of which are of our own making. If we look a little deeper, we may see that loving kindness is the key to our survival.

We went to small towns, &amp; met with farmworkers + meatpackers.  I saw first hand how up to 50% of Iowa’s agricultural workers are immigrant &amp; Latino - many of them rural. These families are revitalizing entire towns in Iowa.  Pundits shouldn’t use “rural” as code for race, either.

Sometimes being a new member of the House feels like being in Hogwarts. There are lots of arcane parliamentary phrases (I jokingly call them “magic spells”) one can learn to speak on the floor or gain exceptions.  Deep knowledge of these rules is rare but can be powerful.
West Coast! It’s your turn to get in on the fun. See who makes it all the way to #HotHands on #GameofGames, right now!
The President’s vindictiveness can't erase the truth: history will remember Lt. Col. Vindman as an American patriot, who proved his heroism both on the battlefield when he earned a Purple Heart &amp; in the House impeachment trial when he spoke truth to power.

TUNE IN 📺: I will be joining @BretBaier ~6:15 PM EST to discuss House Democrats’ unserious $3 trillion wish list and what the Senate is doing to attack this crisis and lead the response. 
Give me a break.  We have spent $3 trillion and offered another $1 trillion to address crisis. 
It is my fundamental conviction that compassion constitutes a basic aspect of our nature as well as being the foundation of our happiness.
For years Fake stories and investigations, then the phony Russia, Russia, Russia HOAX, next Ukraine and the failed Impeachment, now the crummy Atlantic Magazine’s MADE UP STORY, and lastly, the political hit job by rapidly fading Bob Woodward and his boring book. It never ends!

Friends are made on the basis of trust and trust only grows if you are kind to people.
The numbers tell us a clear and convincing story: We're going to win this race.
You can’t make this up: During a global crisis, House Democrats are arguing that the acquittal of President Trump did not actually end their impeachment. They would rather spend another year trying to cram politics into the legal system than help the Senate govern the country. 
...China as a “positive development” for America and the world. If it were up to Joe, bin Laden and Soleimani would still be alive, ISIS would be still on the rampage, and China would now be the dominant power in the world – not America.

Thank you @RepMarkTakano &amp; @VetAffairsDems for their work to curb veteran suicide and securing passage of Veterans’ COMPACT Act, which is headed to the President’s desk. Just as the military leaves no one behind on the battlefield, we leave no veteran behind when they come home. 
Yesterday, my home state of #Kentucky reported its first #COVID19-related death. Our thoughts are w/the family, friends, &amp; neighbors in Bourbon County who are mourning. I am continuing to stay in close touch w/@GovAndyBeshear on treatment &amp; containment efforts in the Bluegrass.

I have released all of my tax returns. 22 years. Go look at them.  What is Donald Trump hiding? 
When I advocate for basic human rights, people will dismiss the substance of what I say due to my “tone.”  But if you’re Trump, some of those same folks will cite “tone” to minimize his reckless flu comparisons, science denial, and lagging response costing 1000s of lives.  Wild. 
President Trump called India "filthy."  It's not how you talk about friends—and it's not how you solve global challenges like climate change.  @KamalaHarris and I deeply value our partnership—and will put respect back at the center of our foreign policy.

Optimism does not mean being blind to the actual reality of a situation. It means maintaining a positive spirit to continue to seek a solution to any given problem. And it means recognizing that any given situation has many different aspects—positive as well as problematic.

This white supremacist thinks Somali refugees are worthless, this is why he cannot accept that a district that is 2/3 white can elect a Somali refugee.   Let this sink in: not only are refugees welcome in Minnesota, but 78% of my district sent this refugee to Congress.

Inner peace depends on warm-heartedness and a concern for others’ well being.
First, Democrats spent weeks saying the House case was totally convincing. Now, the opposite: They say the House case is so thin that if the Senate judges what the House actually voted on, it's a “cover-up."  Their own investigation was so shallow that it now equals a “cover-up”? 
Tune in now to @BretBaier. I’ll be discussing Judge Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court and the Democrats’ ongoing obstruction of more bipartisan COVID-19 relief.

With Joe Biden it has been 47 years of all talk and no action. Under President @realDonaldTrump it’s been 47 months of ALL ACTION, it’s been 47 months of RESULTS, and it’s been 47 months of PROMISES MADE AND PROMISES KEPT! 🇺🇸

Democrats will have to get serious about border security so that a government funding agreement can pass the House, earn 60 votes in the Senate, and receive a presidential signature. All three of these things are needed. One partisan vote in the House won't solve anything.

WATCH. As the past week has shown, every syllable of every word is wrong.  Even worse, this condescending, pompous hectoring—this ignorant hubris—would be the foreign policy approach of a Biden administration. The Abraham Accords would never have happened w/ these guys in charge.

“Immigrants are dirty” is a lazy, tired, racist trope.  Secondly, environmental injustice is a major motivation as to why we introduced and wrote the Green New Deal the way we did in the first place.

The Senate might ADJOURN FOR A MONTH after this bill?  This is completely dangerous and unacceptable. We HAVE to be able to respond to people’s needs.  People don’t have this time. Even IF the Senate can even return on the 20th (big IF) that may not be enough time to solve May.

Happy birthday to the most brilliant, incredible, gorgeous, kind, wonderful, generous, loving, magnificent person I have ever met. (It’s you, Portia.) 
We give corporations huge tax breaks, we can afford to give hardworking Americans a break too.   We can afford to relieve the burden of student debt, provide direct cash payments and healthcare as they struggle through this financial crisis.

Thank you, Chairman. #DefendOurDemocracy 
This pandemic originated in China. Its global spread was made worse by China’s unconscionable efforts to cover it up. Working closely with our allies and partners around the world, the U.S. will be asking tough questions about our relationship with the Chinese Communist Party.

COVID deaths are disproportionately spiking in Black + Brown communities.  Why? Because the chronic toll of redlining, environmental racism, wealth gap, etc. ARE underlying health conditions.  Inequality is a comorbidity. COVID relief should be drafted with a lens of reparations.

Important: mobs destroying monuments WILL BE PROSECUTED. Up to 10 yrs in prison.  It is the policy of the United States to prosecute to the fullest extent...any person that destroys...vandalizes, or desecrates a monument, memorial, or statue w/in the USA. 
The "defund the police" movement, is one of reimagining the current police system to build an entity that does not violate us, while relocating funds to invest in community services.  Let’s be clear, the people who now oppose this, have always opposed calls for systematic change.

Democrats’ power in Minnesota flows through the 5th District bc of our consistently high voter turnout.  This turnout difference isn’t bc Minneapolis is more progressive than other large cities. It’s bc we know how to organize.  And this organizing is why Democrats win in MN.

The workers on the frontlines of this pandemic are making extraordinary sacrifices every single day. They deserve leaders who will listen and work as hard for them as they are for their communities. As president, that’s exactly what I’ll do. 
It is because of my wish to be helpful that I share my ideas and experiences; being helpful to even one person is valuable.

It doesn't look like she is "winning."  And, she obviously doesn't care about the pain she is inflicting in the meantime: Pelosi Is Playing Hardball on Coronavirus Relief. She Thinks She’ll Win. 
Socialism sucks.  With Biden-Harris, this train wreck of an energy policy is coming to your state too.   Their new slogan: if you want to live without air conditioning—vote Democrat. 
Absolutely. Many faith based communities run food pantry, clothing, childcare &amp; debt relief ministries to name a few. Yes, they have mortgages too but all they've stressed to me in our calls w/them, are their concerns for the many struggling people who rely upon them. 
Peace has a great deal to do with warm-heartedness and respect for the lives of others, avoiding doing them harm and regarding their lives as being as precious as our own. If, on that basis, we can also be of help to others, so much the better.
But, occasionally, the metal version 
On TUESDAY, Speaker NANCY PELOSI and Senate Minority Leader CHUCK SCHUMER said the Republicans’ $1 trillion Covid relief plan and the Democrats’ multi trillion-dollar HEROES Act are simply irreconcilable.

Excellent question. RT @stephslad Who needs a soulmate when you have Hamburger Helper®?
Your network is literally arguing to tear down Mount Rushmore.  And claiming that murderous, raping anarchists are a peaceful “street festival.”

The President’s most recent budget called for slashing funding for the Centers for Disease Control, which is on the frontlines of this emergency. And now, he is compounding our vulnerabilities by seeking to ransack funds still needed to keep Ebola in check.

This is unacceptable.  Trump is using this public health crisis as an opportunity to push tax cuts and corporate bailouts.  This is an emergency. We need to help vulnerable people &amp; small biz now w/ paid leave, extended unemployment, UBI, Medicaid expansion,&amp;mortgage suspensions.

This is the issue w/ many “reforms”: yes, you can pass certain laws, but the problem is police *breaking the law.*  Murder is already illegal, but the officers who killed Breonna Taylor STILL haven’t been arrested.  Taking on that abuse of power often takes major political risk.

President Trump’s pardoning of Michael Flynn, who twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his dealings with a foreign adversary, is an act of grave corruption and a brazen abuse of power. 
Perhaps we shouldn’t be looking to the Supreme Court to determine whether or not gravity exists. 
Democrats are doing a great disservice to the law and judiciary by treating these hearings like an emotive political ad. They are telling voters that the courts are nothing more than another arena for political disputes.

All things originate in the mind. Actions and events depend heavily on motivation. Appreciation of humanity, compassion and love are key points. If we develop a good heart, whether our field is science, agriculture or politics, since motivation is so crucial, they’ll all improve.
Every year we sacrifice human lives for the sake of our for-profit healthcare system, &amp; next year is poised to get worse.  What happens when your insurance becomes unaffordable, but you “make too much” for Medicaid? Millions go uninsured &amp; underinsured.  We need #MedicareforAll. 
In Vietnam I had the chance to sit down with some of our @ObamaFoundation leaders and alumni from across the Asia Pacific. From combating climate change in Vietnam to evaluating social impact in Indonesia, they're doing extraordinary work and expanding their impact together. 
Great call with @ACAcamps today about how we can safely reopen summer camps across the country. Summer camps play a vital role in the life of more than 20 million kids and we’ll continue to work with state and local authorities to reopen summer camps whenever possible.

Let’s take this lesson and move it forward to push for a better world.  We CAN guarantee healthcare. We CAN treat housing as a right. We CAN pursue decarceral policy. We CAN prioritize humanitarian foreign policy. We can. We can. We can.
Not only is it the case that happy people are more willing to help others, but as I generally point out, helping others is the best way to help yourself, the best way to promote your own happiness. It is you, yourself, who will receive the benefit.
I finally spoke about the State of the Union. #SOTU 
Ok but is "Swing Swing” still stuck in your head after that episode? @therejects #AmericanIdol
Only 11 counties in America are seeing accelerating new cases, and only about 2% of the counties are seeing any significant increase in cases. The truth is, now that all 50 states &amp; our territories are reopening, we’re proving we can do that in a safe &amp; responsible way. 
Since resentment, anger, and animosity bring us no benefit, it is clearly in our own interest to underpin our attitude to all others with a kind of genuine unconditional and unbiased compassion. And doing so will certainly bring us benefits.

Lives Cut Short: Remembering Health Care Workers In Their 20s Killed By COVID-19 
Believe me, I too wish that a little carbon tax here &amp;a little fuel efficiency there would solve this.  There was a time in the early 90s where those policies could’ve made an enormous difference. But our leadership failed &amp; ran out the clock. Now we need WWII-level mobilization.

Leading in Michigan, leading in Minnesota, leading all over. Sorry! 
This year, #Juneteenth falls during a moment of national reckoning over our country’s brutal racism, past and present.  Today is both a celebration and a renewed commitment to truth and reconciliation, followed by reparations for the harm caused.
Genuine happiness comes from focusing on the happiness of others.
Congrats to Julia and Steven, the filmmakers behind American Factory, for telling such a complex, moving story about the very human consequences of wrenching economic change. Glad to see two talented and downright good people take home the Oscar for Higher Ground’s first release. 
Today is World Suicide Prevention Day. Since a young age I’ve dealt with suicidal thoughts and depression. I’ve been very vocal in raising the awareness of mental health because it is possible to see the light when you start the work on yourself.

This is deranged &amp; hateful.   Banana republics round up &amp; imprison their political opposition, and that’s what Olberman is angrily demanding.   For what possible reason (beyond pure partisan hate) should Judge Amy Coney Barrett be “prosecuted and convicted”?

Judge Amy Coney Barrett is an exceptionally impressive jurist and an exceedingly well-qualified nominee to the Supreme Court.   A brilliant scholar. An exemplary judge. President Trump could not have made a better decision. 
The time is now for all Americans to engage in basic common-sense measures, and for Americans at heightened risk to take additional precautions. The experts’ detailed recommendations for individuals, families, and employers are available online at

Here’s a story about people doing good that's worth sharing: @BradPaisley and his wife @Kimwilliamspais saw food insecurity in Nashville and decided to do something about it. They just broke ground on a free grocery store to help families in need: 
This season really has been filled with emotions. And @ryanseacrest crying memes. Is this the new #MichaelJordanCrying? #AmericanIdol 
It turns out vilifying the police &amp; releasing violent criminals is a REALLY bad idea.  NYC Police Commissioner: “We cannot keep people safe without keeping bad, dangerous, people off the streets. You have a criminal justice system that’s imploding.” 
I’ve released 21 years of my tax returns.   What are you hiding, @realDonaldTrump? 
...Importantly, we also won on the Ballot Cure Provision. Waiting for the BIG Federal decisions in Pennsylvania, Nevada, and elsewhere! 
It is already clear that compassion will not drive Republicans to help the millions of Americans struggling financially from this crisis. But perhaps they can recognize the stimulating effect that helping struggling families will have on our economy. #DeadlineWH

Shooting rubber bullets and tear gas at unarmed protesters when there are children present should never be tolerated. Ever.   What is happening tonight in our city is shameful.   Police need to exercise restraint, and our community needs space to heal. 
Fracking is NOT a transitional fuel, and it is dangerous to say so.  Fracking emits methane, which is about **84 TIMES** more powerful than CO2 in contributing to climate change for a generation.  This is not a joke. We either commit to the science or not.

This year, the Senate has passed $3.8 trillion worth of #COVID19 relief – but we need to do more. That’s why I’m disappointed to see Democrats blocked another bill last week. It’s time to come together ASAP and get more relief to Texans. 
It should be easy to vote - that’s not a controversial position to have. And we should deeply care about disenfranchisement wherever it happens.
At least 37 transgender and gender-nonconforming people have been killed this year, most of them Black and Brown transgender women. It’s intolerable. This Transgender Day of Remembrance, we honor their lives—and recommit to the work that remains to end this epidemic of violence.

If this reporting is correct, then there needs to be accountability at the @DNC.  Even if the DNC’s access to the tool was “solely for security testing” as they claim, ProPublica found major hackable vulnerabilities almost immediately - which means they didn’t do their job. 
This event is unique in that it brings thousands of out-of-town residents — including many young children — to campus, where they participate in high-touch, interactive, hands-on programs for hours at a time both indoors and outdoors.

Far too many of the people who want to prematurely reopen the economy aren’t workers, but the powerful and wealthy — those who benefit most from exploiting workers’ labor.  The wealthy have a history of putting luxury over workers’ livelihoods, and this crisis is no different.

The Committee found no evidence that then-candidate Donald Trump or his campaign colluded with the Russian government in its efforts to meddle in the election. 
Just months ago, Donald Trump was planning to allow oil and gas drilling off the coast of Florida.   Now, with 56 days until the election, he conveniently says that he changed his mind. Unbelievable.   You don't have to guess where I stand: I oppose new offshore drilling.

Reminder: Progressive incumbents winning our primaries by double digits isn’t just “survival” — it’s a mandate for change.  We are here to stay — and so are our progressive, people-first values.
An effective means of teaching someone how to be more warm and compassionate is to use reasoning about the value and benefits of compassion, having them reflect on how they feel when someone is kind to them. This can prepare them to be warmer and more compassionate to others.
The fact is this pandemic has exposed the cracks in our already broken mental health care system.  We can and must do better.  As president, I’ll fight to achieve mental health parity, expand access to care, and wipe out the stigma. #WorldMentalHealthDay

It was great to be back in North Carolina delivering The America First Healthcare Plan! We will provide MORE CHOICES, LOWER COSTS, and BETTER CARE!  
Today, the Supreme Court, including two of the President’s appointees, affirmed that President Trump is not above the law, recognized Congress’s constitutional authority to conduct oversight #ForThePeople &amp; upheld the separation of powers that is the genius of our Constitution.
The historic CARES Act has helped families endure this crisis. But our nation is not done with this fight. More Americans are dying. Millions are unemployed. Added federal unemployment benefits are close to expiring.  Democrats need to get serious and come to the table.

They told us throwing out “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” would damage our military.  They told us “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” was essential protecting America.  They were wrong.  Nine years after DADT was finally repealed, our military is stronger for it. 
Americans have watched peaceful protests hijacked into violent riots that inflict the kind of injustice they supposedly oppose. Small businesses destroyed. Neighborhoods torn up. Police attacked on city streets.   These riots need to stop. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Now.

Anger and aggression sometimes seem to be protective because they bring energy to bear on a particular situation, but what needs to be acknowledged is that that energy is blind. It takes a calm mind to be able to consider things from different angles and points of view.

When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, he thinks “hoax.”   I think “jobs.”  Good paying, union jobs that put Americans to work building a stronger, more climate-resilient nation. 
Iran’s cruel execution of Navid Afkari is a travesty. No country should arrest, torture, or execute peaceful protestors or activists.   Iran must free its other political prisoners, including Nasrin Sotoudeh, and release unjustly detained Americans.

We seek happiness in external things without realizing that they don’t help when we have problems within. We need to focus instead on the joy that comes with peace of mind that allows us to remain happy whatever happens.
That failed. For all the focus on the supposed failures of the movement, Democrats made gains with white suburban voters, especially where racial justice was a major issue.
But here’s something that requires no investigation: In no world can arresting a man for an alleged minor infraction involve a police officer putting his knee on the man’s neck for nine minutes while he cries out “I can’t breathe” and then goes silent.

My bill is responsive to local activism, partnership &amp; the fact that the racial wealth gap could be narrowed w/ transit equity &amp; connectivity. It is informed by my work on the Future of Transportation caucus which I co-founded. Like all things transit is a social justice issue.
For Biden “transition” = strangulation 
Our nation must continue investing in the readiness and modernization of our military. Russia and China aren’t slowing down to wait for us. It would be a grave mistake if Democrats block the Senate from moving forward with defense funding legislation this week.

Let me be very clear, @realDonaldTrump: Not a single one of the 200,000 Americans we've lost to this virus was a "nobody." 
It’s estimated that nearly another 200,000 Americans could lose their lives by the end of the year because of this virus.  Enough. No more.  Let’s set the partisanship aside. Let’s end the politics. Let’s follow the science.
We have to stop criminalizing protest.   State authorities should protect people’s rights not infringe on them.   These mass arrests after trapping them seems cruel and ill advised.

While House Democrats fixate on impeachment, the Senate is working for the American people. This week we confirmed another one of President Trump’s judicial nominees. @POTUS has now appointed 48 appeals court judges, more than any president at this point in his presidency.
Candidate preferences aside, the integrity of our primaries are incredibly serious. We cannot afford to be pointing fingers- we need to pinpoint solutions.  If the DNC was responsible for security and there were security failures, we need to address that.

Wearing a mask isn't a political statement — it's a patriotic duty.
Today the 6 Biden-Sanders Unity Task Forces are unveiling final language.  The Climate Task Force accomplished a great deal. It was an honor to serve as co-chair w/ Sec. @JohnKerry.  Among the notable gains: we shaved *15 years* off Biden’s previous target for 100% clean energy.

President @realDonaldTrump is FOR the American worker! The President’s first directive provides tax relief to hardworking Americans across the Country earning less than $100,000 per year. 
They even blocked 2 commissions - the 2nd which I sponsored with D Senator @GaryPeters - to 1) give the nation a full picture of the issues facing black men and boys, &amp; 2) perform a review of our criminal justice system, and suggest changes to Congress, like the 911 Commission.
Trump’s lawyers argued he has a right to abuse his power as much as he wants, and Congress can do nothing about it.  Sounds familiar:  Trump: “I have an Article 2, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president.”  Congress can do something: hold a fair trial.

This is a freedom loving Country and today we feel on our hearts a particular weight of gratitude to the people who fought and died for that freedom. 
By pulling out of the Paris Agreement, Trump gave up his seat at the table for global climate negotiations a long time ago.  He’s a glorified fossil fuel lobbyist sabotaging the effort to save our future.   Yet he’s not the only one - there are plenty more in our gov &amp; abroad.

Trump has NO PLAN to get people safely back to work.   GOP Govs like Kemp are sending vulnerable workers to die w/ false claims of safety.  Trump also pushed an unproven, dangerous treatment as a “cure” &amp; firing experts who want to vet claims.  Last thing you care abt is safety. 
He recently inked so-called “peace deals” between the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Sudan, and Israel. The only problem? They weren’t peace deals. They’re arms sales to human rights abusers, designed to empower the Gulf States and increase the risk of war with Iran.
It’s been 116 days since the House passed the Heroes Act and the Senate GOP are finally waking up to the damage their decision to “take a pause” has caused in communities nationwide. Republicans must stop blocking efforts to pass the policies included in the #HeroesAct into law. 
In 2016, President Trump promised to reduce the trade deficit and said: "You will see a drop like you've never seen before."  The reality? It's the highest it's been in 12 years.  American workers can't afford another four years of his failed leadership. 
Ugly. Very ugly.

Thank you, @SenSchumer.  One of the bad faith critiques of climate action is “what about other countries?”  Trade deals like the USMCA are 1 of our best opportunities to secure hard commitments on global emission drops.  The USMCA lasts *years* &amp; makes ZERO reduction commitments. 
We’re bringing troops home because we’ve managed to secure stability by strengthening our military and by taking the fight directly to ISIS in Iraq. 
Research shows that hiking the minimum wage to $15 would kill jobs and depress the economy at a time when it’s thriving for the American people. We are not going to be taking that up in the Senate. 
Three years ago today 26 Texans were killed &amp; 20 others injured when a deranged gunman opened fire during a Sunday service at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs. After this horrific tragedy, I introduced the Fix NICS Act.

There are folks running around on TV blaming progressivism for Dem underperformance.  I was curious, so I decided to open the hood on struggling campaigns of candidates who are blaming progressives for their problems.  Almost all had awful execution on digital. DURING A PANDEMIC.

Grateful to @RepThompson and every House Democrat who spoke out during Gun Violence Survivors Week. Gun violence impacts American communities every day. Survivors deserve to know Congress is serious in our commitment to #EndGunViolence. 
Twitter Left is aghast—seems the media/commie list-serve activated them all.  Two observations: (1) Biden has *still* not been sworn in &amp; (2) perhaps I underestimated the vicious authoritarianism of today’s Left—so willing to destroy restaurants, bars, small businesses, lives.... 
Today, on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, I reaffirm my commitment to ending this epidemic. A Biden-Harris administration will take bold action here at home and rejoin global efforts to confront gender-based violence in all its forms.

NAFTA is gone, and the #USMCA is here to stay! President @realDonaldTrump drove a hard bargain and won a great victory for Wisconsin workers and dairy farmers! Under the #USMCA, we’re going to export $300 million more a year in Wisconsin dairy!

Tens of thousands of enthusiastic Americans are coming out each day to support this Administration, and in 15 days we’re going to win FOUR MORE YEARS of President @realDonaldTrump! 🇺🇸 
This is Fake News by the failing @nytimes &amp; bad ratings @CNN. Never suggested it although, based on all of the many things accomplished during the first 3 1/2 years, perhaps more than any other Presidency, sounds like a good idea to me! 
"...the US economy is operating along a bumpy path defined more by the coronavirus and reactions to it than by the inherent dynamics of the economy itself. Yet while the path is bumpy and GDP growth puny, America still has a large and active economy." 
It is encouraging to see our neighbors working enthusiastically to make the USMCA a reality. I urge Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats to catch up to our neighbors and begin to advance the USMCA.

Yesterday, the Speaker celebrated impeachment with souvenir pens, bearing her own golden signature, brought in on silver platters. The House’s partisan process distilled into one last perfect visual. Not solemn or serious. A transparently political exercise from beginning to end. 
Cool Model 3 review by @iamjamiefoxx 
This is my friend TJ. Honest, loyal, hilarious, intelligent and overall just a good dude. When he sent me this video I had tears streaming down my face.. what if something had happened to him years ago and I may have never met him? Or what if something were to happen now? 
American workers are paying the price for Leader McConnell’s efforts to slow-walk our response to COVID-19. Truly inspiring to witness today’s caravan of workers in Washington, driving together to demand that the #SenateActNow to pass the #HeroesAct. #WorkersFirst

Retweet this tweet to see this tweet on your twitter when you tweet.
Dem Governors around America, using the excuse of the Coronavirus pandemic, are talking about mailing ballots to their entire state with no safeguard for the integrity of the process. The principle of one person, one vote is at the center of our Democracy &amp; we must defend it.

As human beings, we are all the same, there is no need to build some kind of artificial barrier between us.
What happened to Rand &amp; Kelley tonight (and numerous others exiting the RNC) was wrong. The police protecting them were heroic, but this needs to stop. This is very close to escalating to serious violence.

Over 100,000 Americans are dead and Congress won’t extend Medicare to the unemployed bc it’s too busy protecting a corporate system that makes pandemics insanely profitable for Wall St.  This is what capitalist healthcare looks like, &amp; it’s wrong. People shouldn’t die for profit. 
While we wait for our Democratic colleagues to let this legislation move forward, the Senate’s used the time to confirm more of President Trump’s impressive nominees for the federal courts.   Totals since January 2017: Supreme Court: 2 Circuit courts: 48 District courts: 120

If we’re going to achieve true justice for George Floyd and dismantle systemic racism in this country, we must radically transform our approach to criminal justice and invest in restorative justice practices. 
We can't let George Floyd and Jacob Blake become just another pair of hashtags.  This is a moment of action.  It's long past time we reform policing, reverse systemic racism, and make our communities safer.
We need to fundamentally change the way our society treats the most vulnerable, make amends for our failed systems and construct a more just society.   Because this has gone on long enough.
Thanks

I agree Black Lives Matter.  I agree there is a pandemic &amp; we have taken extraordinary steps to defeat it.   Where did that pandemic originate?  Why did Communist China COVER UP the Wuhan outbreak &amp; arrest whistle-blowers?  And why are you terrified to say ONE WORD about China? 
It’s still fine to leave your home to buy groceries, go for a run, walk the dog, pick up medicine, visit a doctor or travel to and from work (if designated as an essential business).
Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos are the worst possible people to lead our nation’s schools through this pandemic.

What Are The Health Effects Of The Smoke From Wildfires? 
Everybody knows who Donald Trump is.  Let’s show them who we are.  We choose hope over fear. Unity over division. Science over fiction. And truth over lies.
Secretary DeVos’s assault on public schools is a blatant violation of the law, as has been repeatedly found by the Courts. Read our brief filed today in federal court here: 
President Trump can try and shift blame all he wants, but the fact is Maine's hardworking lobstermen and women are hurting under his watch.  They deserve better. And as President, I will work to protect the livelihood and safety of the fishing community. 
If Donald Trump had acted just two weeks earlier, 54,000 lives could have been spared in March and April alone.   Instead, he downplayed the threat and refused to take action — costing lives and sending our economy into a tailspin.  It’s an unjustifiable dereliction of duty.
Both sides of the aisle have talked a lot about the border crisis. But that’s all House Democrats have done: talk. It’s Senate Republicans who have worked towards a productive, bipartisan compromise that would begin to address the humanitarian crisis at the border.

Playing the Super Bowl last year was indescribable.  It changed my life! So excited to see what Justin’s going to do, I know it will be amazing! #SB52 #SuperBowl #Superbowl52 
It’s great to see Republicans understand this crisis &amp; advocate for socialized medicine.  No one should be charged for getting tested for Coronavirus, &amp; no one should be charged for getting treated.  This applies to pandemics and it should apply to any condition or care you need. 
Happy Birthday to my answered prayer, Conan Harris (CH) Grateful for you! #TeamHarris #LUKK #tillthewheelsfalloff PS. Spread love, not germs. #WearAMask

The House &amp; Senate firmly stood with our students &amp; veterans to reject the Admin’s cruel decision to turn its back on thousands defrauded by predatory colleges. It is sad that the President rejected the will of the Congress and the Country with his veto. 
William Barr has been confirmed by the Senate three times without opposition. He has the experience and is eminently qualified to perform the duties of Attorney General. I hope and expect he will be confirmed next week.
Together, we can set our nation on a new path. One where we finally live up to our highest ideals and everyone gets a fair shot to get ahead.  Let's do this:

Dr. Escott raised concerns about any rush to relax rules aimed at slowing the spread of #COVID19: “This is too soon for us. As we're still preparing contact tracing, ramping up testing, working to protect vulnerable populations, now is not the time to flip on the light switch.”

Donald Trump abused the power of the US government to extort Ukraine into undermining the 2020 elections.  Today’s hearings put Trump’s own fingerprints all over the scene of the crime.  It left no room for him to pin this on anyone else, but plenty to drag others down with him. 
He needs to pull up his mask a little bit

Pretty nauseating how easily Congress rubber stamped a $4 trillion dark slush fund for Wall St as “COVID relief,” yet somehow $600 for workers in pandemic is controversial.  Up close it’s staggering how much resistance there is in Washington to actually helping people directly.
