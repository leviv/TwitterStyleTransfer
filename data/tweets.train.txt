PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
There is a link between our physical and verbal actions and emotions. If, instead of anger, hatred and suspicion, we are moved by loving-kindness, we will naturally have greater respect for others and our actions will be non-violent.
Ask yourself, what am I doing about my anger, my attachment, my pride, my jealousy? These are the things we should check in our daily lives.
Because anger and hostility destroy our peace of mind, it is they that are our real enemy. Anger ruins our health; a compassionate attitude restores it. If it were basic human nature to be angry, there‚Äôd be no hope, but since it is our nature to be compassionate, there is.
#ATXCouncil is back from executive session.  Two more items are on the agenda to discuss today.

Cooperation comes from friendship, friendship comes from trust, and trust comes from kindheartedness. Once you have a genuine sense of concern for others, there‚Äôs no room for cheating, bullying, or exploitation; instead, you can be honest, truthful and transparent in your conduct
When we begin to develop a genuine appreciation of the value of compassion, our outlook on others begins automatically to change.

People who are compassionate, loving, patient, tolerant and forgiving recognize their impact on others and order their conduct accordingly.

Sally Yates is either lying or grossly incompetent. It is not possible she could have known so little about Dirty Cop James Comey (and others) from her high position in the Department of ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù. The political Crime of the Century, and she had no idea what they were doing?
Let‚Äôs reflect on what gives meaning to our lives, and set our priorities on the basis of that. We need to be positive. We weren't born to cause trouble or to do harm to others. For life to be of value, we must develop basic good human qualities‚Äîwarmth, kindness, compassion.
Our thoughts are with the two @LASDHQ Sheriff Deputies who were shot in Los Angeles. We send our love and support to their families and we pray to God for their recovery. 
 
Time is always moving on; nothing can stop it. We can‚Äôt change the past, but we can shape the future. The more compassionate you are, the more you will find inner peace.

Not only is it the case that happy people are more willing to help others, but as I generally point out, helping others is the best way to help yourself, the best way to promote your own happiness. It is you, yourself, who will receive the benefit.

Certain desires are positive: a desire for happiness; for peace; for a more harmonious and friendlier world.
Thank you to our wonderful First Lady! 
Education today tends to focus on material goals. We seek sensory gratification in music or good things to look at, taste and touch. We may enjoy watching a game of sport, but once it ends the joy is over. What we really need is happiness that is rooted in the power of the mind.

Through constant training we can enhance our positive attitudes and thoughts and reduce their opposing negative attitudes.
Anger can be reduced if we work to cultivate love and affection. However, we first have to come to terms with whatever benefits or disadvantages anger may bring. Primarily, anger destroys our peace of mind; loving-kindness earns us friends and eliminates the risk of being alone.
If we make a common attempt to improve our education systems, we can educate the coming generations to be more compassionate.

While many people consider sensory experience as the main source of happiness, really it is peace of mind. What destroys peace of mind is anger, hatred, anxiety and fear. Kindness counters this‚Äîand through appropriate education we can learn to tackle such emotions.
It‚Äôs still fine to leave your home to buy groceries, go for a run, walk the dog, pick up medicine, visit a doctor or travel to and from work (if designated as an essential business).
Peace of mind, a calm state of mind, is rooted in affection and compassion.
Compassion instills a sense of calm, inner strength, and a deep confidence and satisfaction.

Deep down we must have a real affection for each other, a clear recognition of our shared status as human beings.
In our modern society everything seems geared to material development, even our systems of education. As a result we no longer pay sufficient attention to our inner values, which leads to mental unrest. In order to address this imbalance we need to pay more attention to our minds

Celebrating Life: #ATXCouncil has backed moves to rename a portion of State Loop 111 after East Austin's Richard Overton, who at 112 became the oldest living man in the U.S. and the oldest living veteran. He enjoyed ice cream, cigars &amp; whiskey.  üì∑:  
Everyone can understand from natural experience and common sense that affection is crucial from the day of birth; it is the basis of life.

If you have a sincere and open heart, you naturally feel self-worth and confidence, and there is no need to be fearful of others.
Everyone wants to lead a peaceful, happy life, but happiness and success aren‚Äôt measured by how much money you have, but by whether you have inner peace in your heart.

If you develop a pure and sincere motivation, if you are motivated by a wish to help on the basis of kindness, compassion, and respect, then you can carry on any kind of work, in any field, and function more effectively.
All good qualities must be sown and cultivated. We can‚Äôt expect to change overnight from an ordinary person into one with high realizations.
No matter what our motivation may be, if we are not realistic we will not fulfil our goal.
You don‚Äôt want to miss @SeanHannity‚Äôs segment with @KarlRove. Thank you! 
Whether we are happy or not depends on our attitude; compassion, for instance, leads to a calmer mind.

The nature of our motivation determines the character of our work.
A meaningful life isn't about acquiring money and other facilities; it‚Äôs about dedicating your life to helping others as much as you can.

Some people consider the practice of love and compassion is only related to religious practice and if they are not interested in religion they neglect these inner values. But love and compassion are qualities that human beings require just to live together.
To make this a century of dialogue we need to find ways to promote a greater awareness of the oneness of humanity.
Genuine friendship depends on genuine affection and taking a sense of responsibility for each other.
Determination, courage, self-confidence lead to success, but we should always remain humble, modest and unpretentious.

üòÖ thank goodness it‚Äôs not November 
Meditation is about keeping the mind clear; thinking deeply about reality. It‚Äôs about thinking about our emotions, asking ourselves ‚ÄòWhy do I feel angry?‚Äô and coming to understand the advantages and sound basis of positive emotions like warm-heartedness.
Leaving aside the perspective of spiritual practice, even in worldly terms, in terms of our enjoying a happy day-to-day existence, the calmer our minds are, the greater our peace of mind will be and the greater will be our ability to enjoy a happy and joyful life.

Non-violence is a sign of strength, self-confidence and truth.
Peace in the world depends on peace within. If we have that we can approach problems in a spirit of compassion, dialogue and respect for the rights of others‚Äîalways a better solution than resorting to a use of weapons and force. External disarmament depends on inner disarmament.
We must cultivate a universal responsibility toward each other and extend it to the planet that we have to share.
Public comment is being heard on the Austin Strategic Mobility Plan. #ATXCouncil opened a public hearing on the Plan at the last Council meeting (3/28). Today is an additional opportunity for the public to provide feedback directly to Council. Agenda item: 
Go City Hall, it‚Äôs ya birthday! üéâ  15 years ago today, our current Austin City Hall building opened its doors on W 2nd Street.  Some people say the triangular platform that juts out over W 2nd Street resembles an armadillo tail. üëÄ

Human nature is such that the individual is most happy and relaxed when he or she can share happiness and trust with others.
Practicing compassion, caring for others and sharing their problems, lays the foundation for a meaningful life, not only at the level of the individual, family or community, but also for humanity as a whole.

We need to be determined to achieve positive change, and also be able to take a long view of what needs to be done. What is important is not to become demoralized. Optimism leads to success; pessimism leads to defeat. One person can be the source of inspiration for many others.
We have to make a special effort to think of each other as fellow human beings, as our brothers and sisters.
