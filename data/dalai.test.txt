Joy and happiness are mental events and, according to our day to day experience, mental satisfaction is superior to physical pleasure. We need material development, but it’s a mistake to depend on material things alone to find happiness. We also need to be warm-hearted.

We should practise by showing affection and helping one another. It is a mistake to pursue happiness and to seek to the avoid suffering by deceiving and humiliating other people. We must try to achieve happiness and eliminate suffering by being considerate and good-hearted.
Our aim in seeking ways of transforming our thoughts and emotions is to find a more wholesome and fulfilling way of living.
Alongside our natural ability to empathize with others, we also have a need for others’ kindness.
The key to human happiness lies within our own state of mind, and so too do the primary obstacles to that happiness.
The quality of everything we do: our physical actions, our verbal actions, and even our mental actions, depends on our motivation.

I believe that at all levels of society - family, national, and international - the key to a better, happier world is greater compassion.
Improvement requires continuous effort.

Karma means action and action motivated by compassion is good. To complain that what happens to you is just the result of your karma is lazy. Instead, confidently recalling the advice that, "You are your own master," you can change what happens by taking action.
Once they are properly developed, the mind's good qualities increase indefinitely.
More often than not, anger is actually an indication of weakness rather than of strength.
I really feel that some people neglect and overlook compassion because they associate it with religion. Of course, everyone is free to choose whether they pay religion any regard, but to neglect compassion is a mistake because it is the source of our own well-being.

When we’re under the sway of anger or attachment, we’re limited in our ability to take a full and realistic view of the situation. When the mind is compassionate, it is calm and we’re able to use our sense of reason practically, realistically, and with determination.
Cooperation comes from friendship, friendship comes from trust, and trust comes from kindheartedness. Once you have a genuine sense of concern for others, there’s no room for cheating, bullying, or exploitation; instead, you can be honest, truthful and transparent in your conduct

Since we are not solely material creatures, it is a mistake to place all our hopes for happiness on external development alone.
As human beings we are all the same. We have this marvellous intelligence, which sometimes creates problems for us, but when influenced by warm-heartedness it can be really creative and helpful. This is the context in which having moral principles is of such great value.
A mind wishing to benefit other people and other sentient beings is the very basis of peace and happiness.
As we develop more love for others, we’ll have more confidence in ourselves; the more courage we have, the more relaxed and serene we’ll be.
Spiritual practice brings both long-term happiness and more inner strength day by day.
Meaningful dialogue requires us to respect others' rights and interests—compromise is the only way to resolve disputes.
When you find that all human beings are just like you, it fosters a spirit of friendship. You’ll find there's less need to hide things, and as a result, feelings of fear, self-doubt, and insecurity are automatically dispelled. What’s more you’ll earn the trust of other people.
Compassion and love are not a luxury. As the source both of inner and external peace, they are fundamental to the survival of our species.

Since resentment, anger, and animosity bring us no benefit, it is clearly in our own interest to underpin our attitude to all others with a kind of genuine unconditional and unbiased compassion. And doing so will certainly bring us benefits.
There are always problems to face, but it makes a difference if our minds are calm.
It is always helpful to remain honest and truthful in the face of difficulty.
Problems will always arise, but we need to address them differently. We need to engage in dialogue to resolve them rather than resorting to the use of force. #PeaceDayChallenge

Kalachakra for World Peace  - HHDL will be in Washington DC, July 6-16 for empowerment, teachings & other events. 
Our real enemies and the enemies of humanity are negative emotions like anger and hatred. Indeed, people who are dominated by powerful negative emotions should be objects of our compassion.
The most compassionate form of giving is done with no thought or expectation of reward, and grounded in genuine concern for others.
We all want to live a happy life, so we have to learn to live together in trust and mutual respect. We do have differences of race, nationality, religious faith and so on, but these differences are secondary in comparison to our equality in being human.
Sometimes we feel we can’t do much by ourselves, but humanity is made up of individuals; we can make a difference. As individuals we can influence our own families. Our families can shape our communities and our communities form our nations. Together we can make a better world.
All the positive states of mind such as love, compassion, insight and so on, have the quality that you can enhance their capacity and increase their potential to a limitless degree, if you regularly practice them through training and by developing constant familiarity with them.
An effective means of teaching someone how to be more warm and compassionate is to use reasoning about the value and benefits of compassion, having them reflect on how they feel when someone is kind to them. This can prepare them to be warmer and more compassionate to others.
An affectionate disposition not only makes the mind more peaceful and calm, but it affects our body in a positive way too.
I am a man of religion, but religion alone cannot answer all our problems.
Concern yourselves more with the needs of others, with the needs of all humanity, and you'll have peace of mind.
Happiness does not come about only due to external circumstances; it mainly derives from inner attitudes.
It’s unrealistic to think that the future of humanity can be achieved only on the basis of prayer, what we need is to take action.
If we are optimistic, take a longer view, and we employ realistic methods, we can contribute to making the world a better place.

His Holiness the Dalai Lama Honored with NED Democracy Service Medal. Video Link 
Modern education pays little attention to inner values and yet our basic human nature is compassionate. We need to incorporate compassion and warm-heartedness into the modern education system to make it more holistic.
When patience is combined with the ability to discriminate between the action and the one who does it, forgiveness arises naturally.
In the modern world, the interests of a particular community can no longer be considered to lie within the confines of its own boundaries.
A society in which material development co-exists with spiritual progress is one where true happiness is really possible.
If we use favorable circumstances such as good health or wealth to help others, they can be contributory factors to achieving a happier life

Controlling our desire for more, learning to live within realistic limits, is not only in our own interest. It’s also necessary if we are to overcome the challenges to life on Earth that our incessant quest for more generates—since the material resources of this planet are finite

We all have troublesome emotions as well as the positive ones that bring us inner strength and tranquillity. It’s important for us to be aware of our potential and let this inspire our self-confidence. To look only at the negative side and feel hopeless, is, I think, a wrong view

We will only create a more peaceful and harmonious world if we adopt a peaceful approach and engage openly in dialogue.
We may say prayers when we are trying to solve the problems we face, but it is up to us to put an end to violence and bring about peace. Creating peace is our responsibility. To pray for peace while still engaging in the causes that give rise to violence is contradictory.

Determination, courage, self-confidence lead to success, but we should always remain humble, modest and unpretentious.

Live Webcasts: HHDL’s public talks and discussions from Birmingham, Alabama and Princeton, New Jersey on Oct 25-28. 
Every individual is responsible to help guide our global family in the right direction.
We need to think of each other as true brothers and sisters, concerned for each other’s welfare.
Compassion is of little value if it just remains an idea. It must motivate how we respond to others and be reflected in all our thoughts and actions.
The potential for altruistic action lies in all of us, and it is possible on a daily basis for anyone.
Inner transformation is not a matter of faith or prayer. It involves reason and the use of human intelligence. A calm and healthy mind has a very positive effect on our physical health and well-being.
We find that when we act out of concern for others, the peace this creates in our own hearts brings peace to everyone we associate with.
In our world today, we’re heavily dependent upon each other. It’s essential, therefore, that we cooperate with one another—then we’ll be able to solve many problems. Good relations, heart to heart, are important and necessary—everything depends upon our having a good motivation.
The purpose of life is to be happy. This is what all human beings have in common—the wish to lead a happy life. Many think that happiness is to be found outside us in material things, but actually it’s something that comes from within, from warm-heartedness and concern for others
Whether we are happy or not depends on our attitude; compassion, for instance, leads to a calmer mind.
Wherever I go, I always feel the people I meet are the same as human beings like me. Scientists have also observed that we human beings are social animals. We have a sense of community. Right from birth we have the same feelings of closeness to those around us.

The nature of our motivation determines the character of our work.
Anger, suspicion and jealousy disturb our minds. The antidote to these emotions is to cultivate patience and tolerance. Who provides us the opportunity to develop it? The one we call our enemy. Therefore, we can see him or her as a teacher.
Past history clearly shows that violence cannot solve problems.
A fundamentally positive approach is to take account of the oneness of humanity. Dividing the world into 'us' and 'them' might have worked in the past, but it doesn't any more. We have to talk through our problems with our opponents, thinking of them as our fellow human beings.

It is worth reminding ourselves that the greatest joy and satisfaction in life come from actions we undertake out of concern for others.
Harmony among the major faiths has become an essential ingredient of peaceful coexistence in our world.
Human nature is such that the individual is most happy and relaxed when he or she can share happiness and trust with others.
If we develop a good heart, real appreciation, love and compassion for others, our life will improve.
In general I think that anger is a sign of weakness and tolerance a sign of strength.
I am one of the 7 billion human beings alive today. We each have a responsibility to think about humanity and the good of the world because it affects our own future. We weren’t born on this planet at this time to create problems but to bring about some benefit.
What we find is that the more we develop concern for others' well-being, the easier it becomes to act in others' interests.
It’s clear that the ultimate source of happiness is warm-heartedness.
Time is always moving on; nothing can stop it. We can’t change the past, but we can shape the future. The more compassionate you are, the more you will find inner peace.
Because society is the basis of our own happiness, it makes sense for us to take care of others.
There are always problems to face, but it makes a difference if our minds are calm. On the surface we may get upset, but it makes a difference if we are able to stay calm in the depths of our minds.

The many factors which divide us are actually much more superficial than those we share.
We forget that despite the superficial differences between us, people are equal in their basic wish for peace and happiness.
Affection, warm-heartedness, that makes us happy; wealth alone can’t do that.
Anger may bring extra energy, but it eclipses the best part of our brain: its rationality. The energy of anger is almost always unreliable.
All things originate in the mind. Actions and events depend heavily on motivation. Appreciation of humanity, compassion and love are key points. If we develop a good heart, whether our field is science, agriculture or politics, since motivation is so crucial, they’ll all improve.
A calm mind makes us relaxed, improves our health and makes for happier families and communities.

When you generate a reasoned desire for others to be happy, your humanity increases in strength.
Inner beauty, warm-heartedness and compassion, is what brings about peace of mind.
As you develop a more compassionate attitude, you feel less anxiety, while your determination and self-confidence increase.
What we need today are universal values based not on faith but on scientific findings, common experience and common sense.

Live Webcast: HHDL at University of Miami: The Quest for Happiness in Challenging Times - October 26, 1:30pm EDT 
World peace can only be based on inner peace. If we ask what destroys our inner peace, it's not weapons and external threats, but our own inner flaws like anger. This is one of the reasons why love and compassion are important, because they strengthen us. This is a source of hope
The only factor that can give protection from the destructive effects of anger and hatred is the practice of tolerance and patience.
The practicing of loving kindness toward one's enemy is the ultimate test of one's own spiritual attainment.
One of the best ways to begin familiarizing ourselves with the virtue of patience is to reflect systematically on its benefits.
Many of the problems we face today are our own creation. Creating a more peaceful world requires a peaceful mind and a peaceful heart. As human brothers and sisters we must live together in tolerance and affection.
I’m optimistic that there is a growing appetite for peace in the world. Many young people are fed up with war and violence.
I am encouraged by the clear acknowledgment of the need to seek non-violent resolutions of conflict in a spirit of reconciliation.

Problems created by human beings have to be solved by human beings. Basic human nature is compassionate and this is our source of hope.
Compassion and love are the source of all spiritual qualities: forgiveness, tolerance, all the virtues.
Anger and aggression sometimes seem to be protective because they bring energy to bear on a particular situation, but what needs to be acknowledged is that that energy is blind. It takes a calm mind to be able to consider things from different angles and points of view.
When you face problems in your lives, don’t resort to the use of force, try to employ dialogue to find a solution.
To reduce destructive emotions we need to strengthen constructive emotions. For example, to counter anger we cultivate love and compassion.
When our intentions toward others are good, we find that any feelings of shyness or insecurity we may have are greatly reduced.
Time is always moving on; nothing can stop it. We can't change the past, but we can learn from it to shape the future. Stress on ‘us’ and ‘them’ is a source of conflict. We neglect basic human qualities of kindness and compassion. Let’s work together to create a happier future.
Together with material development, we need spiritual development so that inner peace and social harmony can be experienced.

We tend to forget that despite the superficial differences between us, people are equal in their basic wish for peace and happiness.
We may say prayers when we are trying to solve the problems we face, but it is up to us to put an end to violence and bring about peace. Creating peace is our responsibility. To pray for peace while still engaging in the causes that give rise to violence is contradictory.
If we do nothing to restrain our angry, spiteful, and malicious thoughts and emotions, happiness will elude us.
Love, kindness, compassion and tolerance are qualities common to all the great religions, and whether or not we follow any particular religious tradition, the benefits of love and kindness are obvious to anyone.
Co-operation comes from friendship, friendship comes from trust, and trust comes from kind-heartedness.
Human beings are social creatures, and a concern for each other is the very basis of our life together.
Friendship depends on trust and trust depends on having a strong sense of concern for the welfare of others. Be honest, truthful and warm-hearted. Make compassion the basis of your determination. Think of what the future can be, not what happened in the past.
In our human life, tolerance is very important, it helps you overcome difficulties. Without it, tiny things irritate you and you overreact.
We cannot overcome anger and hatred simply by suppressing them. We need to actively cultivate the antidotes: patience and tolerance.

Protecting our environment is not a luxury we can choose to enjoy, but a simple matter of survival.
Compassion enhances our self-confidence because a calm mind allows our marvellous human intelligence to bloom. When we’re angry, our thinking is distorted and we don’t see the different aspects of reality. A calm mind enables us to take a broader, more realistic view.
We need to encourage an understanding that inner peace comes from relying on human values like, love, compassion, tolerance and honesty.
What makes our human life precious is our marvellous brain. We have an ability to cultivate compassion in a way no other beings can do.
