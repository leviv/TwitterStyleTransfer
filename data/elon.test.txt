Once again, I must recommend  
Tesla Model S estimated EPA range is now above 390 miles or ~630 km 
High altitude wind shear data shows a probable 2% load exceedance. Small, but better to be paranoid. Postponing launch to tomorrow, assuming winds are better then.
These were based on direct requests from their ICU wards, with exact specifications of each unit provided before shipment
Great rebuttal by a Tesla owner to those calling for Autopilot to be disabled. Was written with zero input from us. 
New model for evolution of intelligent life suggests probable emergence 2 billion years ago near galactic center 
Next month is also when our Dragon spaceship docks with the Space Station for the first time. Major pucker factor...
Rocket booster reentry, landing burn &amp; leg deploy were good, but lost hull integrity right after splashdown (aka kaboom)
First 1000 Boring Company Flamethrowers being picked up today! 
Our custom 144 TOPS in-vehicle inference computer, where almost every TOP is useable &amp; optimized for NN, far exceeds anything else in volume production, giving you the hardware you need to run sophisticated nets
Congrats to @dmetcalf for being the first to drive a Tesla Model S over 400 miles on a single charge!
Falcon 9 at sunset 
Tesla dual motor cars are also all-wheel drive. Main goal of dual motor was actually insane traction on snow. Insane speed was a side effect
Latest vertical landing rocket vid. 325M altitude, hold against wind, land w T/W&gt;1, radar in loop 
Will be live streaming the Gigafactory launch party tonight. Check  this eve.
Official Gigafactory address to be: Electric Avenue, McCarran, Nevada
Fixed. Now it's good.
Nothing can escape gravity, not even black holes (and they really tried!)
Duck emoji FTW
In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land &amp; not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY
Thud!

Data upload from tracking plane shows landing in Atlantic was good! Several boats enroute through heavy seas.
Really tempting to redesign upper stage for return too (Falcon Heavy has enough power), but prob best to stay focused on the Mars rocket
More Kerbal! 
Fate *loves* irony. Frankly, too much.

More background: I arrived in North America at 17 w $2000, a backpack &amp; a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro &amp; Greg Khouri (love bro &amp; loved Greg, may he RIP)
Btw, vast majority of credit for SolarCity should go to Lyndon &amp; Peter Rive &amp; their awesome team. I'm just a small part.

Tesla history trivia: we didn‚Äôt actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He‚Äôd originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later. 
Sounds like this might be a good time to unveil the new Dragon Mk 2 spaceship that @SpaceX has been working on w @NASA. No trampoline needed

Entropy is the ultimate boss battle 
Exciting to see all the new electric vehicles coming to market! We created Tesla to accelerate a sustainable future &amp; it‚Äôs happening! 
To be clear, Tesla is strongly in favor of people being allowed to drive their cars and always will be. Hopefully, that is obvious.
Only a matter of time before advanced AI is used to do this. Internet is particularly susceptible to a gradient descent algo.

Need to investigate the upper stage Z actuator. Was behaving strangely. Next launch attempt on Friday at 5am.

Elon was found passed out against a Tesla Model 3, surrounded by "Teslaquilla" bottles, the tracks of dried tears still visible on his cheeks.   This is not a forward-looking statement, because, obviously, what's the point?  Happy New Month!

Tesla exists to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate change, which affects all species on Earth. Even if your faith in humanity is faltering, this is worth caring about. Support makes a difference. Thank you.

Btw, Foster the People is playing the Model X event tonight. Seemed like the right vibe.
Falcon 9 delivered Dragon to its target orbit. All good on the rocket.
Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.

Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)
